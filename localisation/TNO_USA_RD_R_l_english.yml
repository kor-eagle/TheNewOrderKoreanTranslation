 USA_lbj_64_the_johnson_presidency_desc:0 "경선부터 대선까지 1년이 넘는 고된 선거 운동 끝에 린든 B. 존슨은 대통령에 취임했습니다. "위대한 사회"를 모토로 내세우며 집권한 그는 무슨 방법을 사용해서라도 미국 사회를 개혁할 예정입니다. 이러한 개혁은 케네디의 진보주의의 연장선이며, 시민권 확장, 의료 보험 확대, 빈곤의 종식은 이 나라를 확실히 바꿀 것입니다. 또한 , 존슨은 군의 현대화를 통해 바꾸어군을 개선할 것이라 주장합니다.\n\n그러나 그가 이러한 개혁을 진행하기 전에 그는 국민들의 신뢰를 얻어야 합니다. 존슨은 취임사에서 자신의 계획과 미래를 위해 행동할 것이라 약속했습니다."

 USA_lbj_64_mistakes_of_nixon_desc:0 "닉슨 대통령의 임기 동안의 미국은 그야말로 최악이었습니다. 남아프리카 전쟁이 시작되었고, 민권 운동이 절정에 달했으며, 헌정이래 최악의 정치적 스캔들이 발생했습니다. 또한, 닉슨이 사임을 한 이후에도 대통령직을 승계한 존 F. 케네디가 암살 당하는 등의 악재가 겹쳤습니다. 존슨 대통령이 본인뿐만아니라 공화-민주당에 대한 국민의 신뢰를 다시 얻을려면 국민들에게 이러한 문제들이 해결될 것이라는 믿음을 주어야 합니다. 남아프리카 전쟁에서 승리하고, 인종 평등을 이루고, 스캔들이나 부패가 발생하지 않을 것을 약속해야 합니다."

I don't care how much they will cry and scream of federal 'oppression', they will not prevent blacks and other minorities from being able to access businesses for needed purchases, and public facilities for needed assistance in their daily lives.

 USA_lbj_64_for_those_worthy_desc:0 "Even though we must be a beacon of hope and freedom, we cannot just completely open the borders to every human on the planet. Instead, we must consider excluding certain amounts of individuals based on a lack of skills that could be problematic to our country's security. All elements of possible moral defect from immigrants must be screened, and possibly excluded if a threat to national security. Yet if we actually consider excluding certain people based on subjective morality, we would be doing damage to our own country's potential. This decision must be made with respect to all options."

 USA_lbj_64_immigration_nationality_act_desc:0 "This bill will make sure more immigrants are able to enter. But their entry will be based on deserving qualifications that can make them potential Americans. Qualifications such as a education, needed skills, and so forth will be sought after to make sure they get priority in our new system. Another major provision for this law will give immigrants a clearer path for naturalization as well. Finally, racial qualifications are eliminated completely, to allow for a more fair and just system of entry that represents the moral character of this entire country. Let's make this immigration system more fair and just for future Americans of the world!"
 USA_lbj_64_roof_over_head:0 "A Roof Over One's Head"
 USA_lbj_64_roof_over_head_desc:0 "We cannot allow any Americans who are minorities to suffer housing discrimination any longer. Afro-americans, Mexicans, and Asians all suffer from constant discrimination despite their hard working in moving up. Most of them live in slums, in misery, or in the streets where they end up causing problems for the rest of us. Even though many of our white American voters want nothing to do with them, letting the colored suffer in squalor will not only make our country continue to look bad, we will possibly not fully secure support for our party from these new voters in the next election. I implore my fellow Republicans and fellow Democrats to support the Fair and Housing Act not only for our coalition's sake, but the sake of America."
 USA_lbj_64_ghetto_riots:0 "Use the Ghetto Riots"
 USA_lbj_64_ghetto_riots_desc:0 "Look at the chaos! The looting, destruction, and violence has ruined so many of our great cities. And that looting and destruction comes from African-American ghettos that remained impoverished, in destitution, and utter misery thanks to our current party's inability to solve this crisis. We must do something to soothe the anger and rage from the black community, as well as prevent more violence between fellow Americans of all colors. The riots showcase the current failures of our government, as we remain in stagnation with the bill. This inaction must end, or else our black citizens will be in future jeopardy."

 USA_lbj_64_yes_in_my_backyard_desc:0 "Now I understand the worries about less fortunate people entering your beautiful suburban homes and wonderful neighborhoods. Maybe you are afraid that they will give your neighborhood a bad name, or that they would cause trouble, or that they would even not be able to fit in and end up excluding you from society. However, that will not be the case! If you can get your congressman to support the Fair Housing Act, you can be guaranteed the less fortunate will be able to rise to your own level with their hard work and dedication. Those underprivileged people who end up having an easier time moving in will become your friend, and if anything, make your neighborhood stronger. I implore you as a good and kind American citizen to help the less fortunate in their struggles for an independent and happier life. Let's say yes for an even stronger backyard!"
 USA_lbj_64_the_FHA:0 "The Fair Housing Act"
 USA_lbj_64_the_FHA_desc:0 "We have come so far on civil rights, yet we need to finish the job. The Fair Housing Act, should we manage to push it through, will be this administration's last great legislative achievement in the civil rights debate. By prohibiting any and all discrimination in renting and selling housing, we will see a profound change in the character of our towns and cities.\n\nThe scale of change that the Fair Housing Act would bring, and its status as the last 'great' civil rights bill by this administration, have made it the center of a political firestorm. Segregationists see the housing issue as the last great bulwark against 'enforced desegregation', and will oppose the bill as strongly as they can. Many within our own party encourage compromise to prevent extensive fallout with conservative voters. Meanwhile, African Americans look to the White House to see if the President is as good as his word.\n\nAny of our choices will have consequences, but choose we must."

 USA_lbj_64_war_on_poverty_desc:0 "Poverty has been an immense drag on our society and has plagued the United States since the dawn of the Industrial Revolution. Both in our cities and our most rural communities, millions live in a state of squalor. A lack of economic opportunity subjects generations of Americans to an endless cycle of hardship. No more! Now, the United States is in a state of war against an enemy older and more elusive than any nation: poverty itself. Through new programs and initiatives, we will stamp out poverty so that all can succeed thanks to the government's helping hand."
 USA_lbj_64_community_action_initiative:0 "Community Action Initiative"
 USA_lbj_64_community_action_initiative_desc:0 "Talk on the national and federal levels about fully addressing poverty is nice, but only through the mobilization of communities throughout the nation can we have the manpower needed to confront economic abjection. With new outreach programs that would encourage participation on both the local and societal level, we can grant new opportunities to the poor to ensure that no one struggles to get by. The federal government will serve as a guiding hand leading impoverished communities wherever they are found to prosperity."
 USA_lbj_64_job_corps:0 "Propose the Job Corps"
 USA_lbj_64_job_corps_desc:0 "Youth unemployment rates in the United States are of great concern to the President as well as the Department of Labor. In yet another project to add to a regimen of proposed welfare and outreach programs, we aim to create the Job Corps. This organization under the larger Department of Labor would provide education to equip America's youth for a multitude of fields as well as work until they can get back on our feet. The majority of their service would be spent improving national parks, impoverished communities, and other areas which have fallen under the responsibility of the federal government. Hopefully, the program will provide vital training and experience to those who need it most."

 USA_lbj_64_vista_of_future_desc:0 "The Volunteers in Service to America, or VISTA, program is the next proposed organization under the OEO umbrella, aiming to provide lower-income communities with new opportunities while also serving the rest of the nation. Similar to the Peace Corps, VISTA provides members with a steady income, health coverage, and a myriad of other benefits in exchange for volunteer service. Recipients will not only see other areas outside of their communities but will also gain the skills needed to fill the many roles mandated by today's industrial economy. Let's get to work!"
 USA_lbj_64_more_food_stamps:0 "Solidify the Food Stamps Program"
 USA_lbj_64_more_food_stamps_desc:0 "Already, we have seen great success within our food stamps program. In areas currently running the program, the impoverished have enjoyed greater access to food, as they no longer have to fight over scraps. This experiment has had its shortcomings, the administrative burden has been higher then what we expected. In addition, making sure the stamps are distributed to all who need them has proven difficult. As we continue expanding, we will have to keep an eye to patch out these kinks within the program.\n\n In light of the program's success, it's time to go nationwide. We will immediately begin expansion into new states. Before too long, the entire Nation will have access to the Food Stamps program. With this step, our war on poverty will be all the closer to being won."
 USA_lbj_64_EOA_act:0 "The Economic Opportunity Act"
 USA_lbj_64_EOA_act_desc:0 "The vast majority of the poverty-stricken are simply down on their luck, stuck at the bottom with no way out. It is not uncommon for a citizen to simply lose their job and fall below the poverty line whilst unable to find new employment. We cannot allow our people to fall by the wayside, forsaken and forgotten.\n\n President Johnson will be introducing a new bill designed to combat these issues. The Economic Opportunity Act will start by increasing unemployment subsidies and provide a government assisted service to find new employment. Not only this, the act will assist those already in the workforce, increasing federal minimum wage. This new bill will show the people what we are striving for, paving the way for further legislation."
 USA_lbj_64_consolidate_programs:0 "Consolidate the Programs"
 USA_lbj_64_consolidate_programs_desc:0 "During our administration, we have managed to create several assistance programs throughout these great states. As helpful as these programs may be, we have constantly been slowed down by the unending bureaucracy involved in running these programs on a state by state basis. If we are to reach the greatest number of people, we are going to have to start cutting red tape.\n\n Unifying all of our programs under the federal government is sure to both reduce the administrative burden and lower overall costs. However, many will see this as an expansion to federal power as we take control out of state hands. Within the more conservative parts of our Country, this is unlikely to be a popular measure."
 USA_lbj_64_increase_minimum_benefits:0 "Increase Minimum Benefits"
 USA_lbj_64_increase_minimum_benefits_desc:0 "Our current benefits program is a welcome reprieve for the poor, but for the most absolutely worst off even these payments are not enough. If we are to lift all Americans out of poverty and damnation, we must increase our payments to the poorest recipients of welfare. Only by giving them the help they need can these people finally be brought out of the poverty trap."

 USA_lbj_64_nobody_left_behind_desc:0 "There is no doubt that we have done great work. In our years running the country, our administration has made large strides in improving the life of the average American. We have reformed education, engineered social security, and have even widened access to proper medical care. The Great Society program has reached out and made America a better place, and yet, we can make it even better.\n\n The Great Society program was formed to help all Americans, regardless of creed, gender, or race. The time has come to begin reaching out to the disadvantaged within our Country. We will begin work on legislation that will allow minorities, women, and all those discriminated against the opportunity to seek better jobs, better education. Regardless of how some might feel, we will not let any American get left behind on our path towards the future."
 USA_lbj_64_safety_net:0 "안전망"
 USA_lbj_64_safety_net_desc:0 "Individuals and businesses that are most financially at risk can easily be pushed over the edge by a sudden calamity or monetary setback. We must ensure that these people have access to a financial "safety net," a means of shielding them from the worst impacts of a sudden and unexpected expense.

 USA_lbj_64_neither_race_nor_class_desc:0 "We have already done much to bring equality to America, but there remains an issue to be dealt with. While our people are no longer legally burdened by race, many minorities are still greatly disadvantaged by the economic conditions they face as a result of years of neglect and persecution. If we are to truly free the people from the shackles of the past, we must amend our existing civil rights legislation to also provide concrete legal protections to the economically disadvantaged. We must ensure that all people, no matter their race, their color or their stature in life are treated with respect and with dignity."

Now, we have ensured that all may be free. All Americans might live unbound by both law and poverty; all men, be they black or white, rich or poor, young or old, might now truly be placed on even footing from which they may work together to make America the best it can possibly be."

 USA_lbj_64_welfare_of_people_desc:0 "Despite illusions of economic success compared to our enemies to both the West and the East, the country is suffering from numerous crises that continue to strike those in the lowest strata of the population. Homelessness, poverty, and an inability to obtain even the most basic services are now endemic to the country, and, through a regimen of new programs, President Johnson plans to address the domestic issues facing the nation. For centuries, the federal government has taken a backseat in helping the poor, whether due to constitutional restraints or other impediments. Now, the federal government's role must be reexamined so that one thing can become clear: the phrase "promote the general welfare" is a mandate, not an ideal."
 USA_lbj_64_prevention_best_cure:0 "Prevention is the Best Cure"
 USA_lbj_64_prevention_best_cure_desc:0 "In areas where people are deprived of the tools they need to succeed in today's economy, poverty takes root. For that reason, we must nip it in the bud before it can even be given the chance to bloom. Through establishment of higher education standards and grants where they are needed most, we can ensure that America's youth are educated enough to take on high-level jobs in an ever-changing economy."

 USA_lbj_64_begin_pilot_programs_desc:0 "Preparations are now underway for President Johnson's clash with the endlessly inhibiting forces of poverty. To begin this struggle, we will pass a series of small-scale assistance programs. While not creating a significant impact themselves, they will hopefully set the stage for even greater projects that will follow in the months. However, for now, we may offer benefits to America's poor in the short-term."

 USA_lbj_64_create_OEO_desc:0 "President Johnson's campaign to lift America's poor out of their hardship will be a massive undertaking from start to finish. The creation of a new bureaucracy and the many accompanying programs necessitates coordination on a large scale.

 USA_lbj_64_assess_current_programs:0 "Assess Current Programs"
 USA_lbj_64_assess_current_programs_desc:0 "Before new programs can be proposed and passed into law, an inquiry into the current federal policy situation is warranted. Currently, various welfare programs from past administrations exist, with their own funds and bureaucracies, under the executive branch. Before moving to more bold measures, President Johnson has recommended an examination of these programs to determine the best method of management is for future programs. Determining what is unnecessary and "cutting the fat" where needed would also be prudent for the sake of fiscal responsibility."
 USA_lbj_64_stopgap_measures:0 "Stopgap Measures"
 USA_lbj_64_stopgap_measures_desc:0 "Like most major changes in federal policy, the expansion and creation of the welfare system will take time, both due to opposition and the overall sluggishness of the American system of government in implementing reform. However, for the moment, more gradual and incremental measures can be taken to temporarily quench the need for aid. Most of these programs will be short-lived, only providing fixes in the short term that give economic assistance to the needy. Much greater projects are coming down the pipeline but a reminder to the people that something is being done to address these issues will go a long way."

 USA_lbj_64_protect_most_vulnerable_desc:0 "Like in so many other economic crises, the ones most affected by our defective healthcare system are the nation's poor. Even as the advancement of technology marches forward, they are tragically left behind and swindled out of the care they need. In the first of many acts to improve the situation, President Johnson has signed a list of executive orders and urged legislation through Congress. These preliminary bills, which will do little on the long run, aim to protect those who cannot take care of themselves due to the unchecked distortion of the healthcare industry."
 USA_lbj_64_trumans_idea:0 "Truman had the Right Idea!"
 USA_lbj_64_trumans_idea_desc:0 "Two decades ago, President Truman proposed legislation that would revolutionize the American healthcare system. Seeing the pitiful state of the health industry, he proposed widespread government action to address the growing problem. At the center of his proposal was universal coverage for all, covering all aspects of care, and massive investment into the construction of hospitals throughout the country. This kind of action is long overdue, and so President Johnson has adopted many of the same policies championed by Truman in his campaign to insure the nation's health."

 USA_lbj_64_revisit_wmd_bill_desc:0 "In 1945, Senators Wagner, Murray, and Dingell proposed legislation to Congress to reform the nation's healthcare system.

The idea for such a system, called Social Security by its proponents, has been floated as early as the 1930s. However, due to a lack of will from politicians, the idea never gained the traction necessary for widespread recognition. President Johnson, as part of a larger welfare plan, aims to bring Social Security to the forefront as a major aspect of his policy.

Its foremost mission is to uplift destitute communities - black-majority counties, rural backwaters, Native American reservations - from poverty's crushing grip, so bringing into fruition the great society President Johnson has long dreamed."

USA_LBJ_healthcare_programs_1_desc:0 "The foundations for President Johnson's proposed healthcare system lay with its insurers. While the existing insurance market's present deregulated state theoretically depresses cost through competition, decades of data prove that it suffers from exorbitant premiums for wildly inconsistent quality of service.\n\nTo rein in the former and standardize the latter, the President shall sign legislation regulating the transactions between private insurance companies and their customers. These "bandaids" to American healthcare, he argues, prelude further enhancements during his term. The specifics of said enhancements remain a matter of speculation for the public."

So secure are these providers of care that they take their earnings and freedoms as a given, rather than as a privilege bestowed by the absence of oversight. Nevertheless, dogged refusal against government intrusions into their fields has hampered past attempts to establish wider-covering healthcare paid for by Congress.\n\nOvercoming the industry's efforts against government healthcare is a must for the President's agenda. Support for it has thankfully grown among the American public, although at like rate as Congressional and private opposition."

Region-wide alliances between plans have since sprung up to prevent the occurrence of ruinous price wars between facilities, and to expand their customer base by offering the same services and premiums to a wider geographical area.\n\nPresident Johnson has taken the concept a step further by establishing the Blue Cross and Blue Shield Association, now the largest federation of insurance companies in the United States. In effect, BCBA has standardized healthcare coverage for every one in three American - a ratio that may increase to two in five by the end of the decade."

##### LBJ EVENTS


 LBJ.1.t:0 "The Inauguration Speech"
 LBJ.1.desc:0""My fellow countrymen: on this occasion, the oath that I have taken before you is not one I take alone, but one that we take together. We are one nation, and one people. We may have different colors or speak different tongues, but the banner which we follow remains the same. We are all Americans, and as such, we must work together for the further betterment of our country; work together for the creation of a great society."\n\n"For the past few decades, life in America has been greatly diminished: the recessions of the 30's and 50's, the loss in the World War, the Akagi Accords, and so on. Our nation has faced hardship for so long and suffered so much, it is easy to forget what we once were, and what we could be. America as a whole is strong, but her people do not reflect such. In a land of great wealth, families must not live in hopeless poverty. In a land rich in harvest, children just must not go hungry. In a land of healing miracles, neighbors must not suffer and die untended. In a great land of learning and progress, young people must be taught to read and write. In a great society, the people have equal opportunity, and the rights of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness."\n\n"At present, America does not reflect this ideal of a great society; politicians in Washington vote on party lines, rather than by beliefs or principles; the minorities of our nation still toil under great discrimination; and more than a quarter of the country lives in poverty. I say to you now, America: this cannot stand. I have served this nation for more than 30 years of my life. I have struggled against this waste of our potential, our freedom, and our great wealth, but I cannot do it alone. I will repeat today what I said on that sorrowful day in November last year: I will lead and I will do the best I can. But you, America, you must look within your own hearts to the old promises and to the old dreams for guidance. The ideals of the old America will become the creed of the new one. God bless you all, and God bless this great nation."
LBJ.1.a:0 "Strong words from a strong leader"

 LBJ.2.t:0 "Strange Bedfellows"
 LBJ.2.desc:0 "As President Johnson prepares the groundwork for his "Great Society," he has found that the road to implementing his vision may be rougher than he originally thought. Many of the more conservative Democrats are unlikely to take kindly to such broad government programs, and the Far-Right NPP are sure to oppose much of what he plans on sheer principle, no matter how well he lays it out. With the balance of power in the senate more precarious than ever, all it would take is a few opposition votes to block his plans and derail everything he has worked for.\n\nThere is, however, a force within the senate that might be willing to aid the president. The Center NPP shares many of the president's core beliefs, with Center leader Robert F. Kennedy having passionately spoken out about the state of poverty in America in the past. For this reason, President Johnson has mulled over the possibility of an agreement between the Republican-Democrats and the Center NPP. In exchange for giving some concessions to the Center, they will surely be willing to give Johnson the votes he needs to pass whatever measures he likes and implement the Great Society to its fullest extent.\n\nThe only problem is the ruckus this will likely cause within his own party. After years of bitter divide between the two parties, there is likely to be much consternation at the idea of a partnership, especially from the Democratic contingent of the party. However, after much consideration, President Johnson has deemed it the best course of action, and intends to write a long letter to Robert Kennedy offering an olive branch, laying out the many ways a partnership between the two men may bear fruit not just for each other, but for America."
 LBJ.2.a:0 "Now where did I leave my pen?"

 LBJ.3.t:0 "Unease Within the Democrats"
 LBJ.3.desc:0 "As predicted, the Democrats are not at all happy with President Johnson's overtures to the Center NPP. As news of his letter to Robert F. Kennedy spreads, many within the R-D's junior party have expressed their anger at the president looking to "get in bed with our political enemies." Vice President McCulloch today reportedly went as far as to suggest that going any further down this road of cooperation "would be a serious betrayal of the union between the Republicans and Democrats."\n\nThis has thrown a spanner in the works of the president's plans, but not an unanticipated one. Already he has moved to reassure Democratic senators that any cooperation with the Center NPP would be purely on a basis of convenience, and that in no way would he overturn the Republican-Democrats' principles in the interests of gaining their support. This has quietened some of the murmurs, but there is still some concerns as to what exactly the Center will demand for their assistance.\n\nRobert F. Kennedy has yet to formally respond to the president's missive, though many political pundits agree it is only a matter of time before he does, as this presents the first real chance for the NPP to gain a taste of power after their defeat in the election mere months ago. Some have even noted the irony of a Republican president once again working with a Kennedy."
 LBJ.3.a:0 "We are stronger united, why can't they see that?"

 LBJ.4.t:0 "존슨과 케네디의 만남"
 LBJ.4.desc:0 "Robert F. Kennedy has responded positively to President Johnson's offer of cooperation and agreed to meet with him at the White House to discuss the terms of an agreement between their parties. The meeting between the two men began pleasantly enough, with Kennedy taking the time to praise some of Johnson's proposed reforms and complemented him on his willingness to reach across the aisle to do what was right for the country.\n\nHowever, Kennedy made it clear that there were other things he wanted from this agreement than just good thoughts and proceeded to lay out a list of conditions, drawn up by both himself and other Center NPP senators, that he would require for any agreement to be made. Some of these issues were mostly compatible with President Johnson's intended course, but a sticking point did emerge. A key demand – that Kennedy insisted he would not budge on – was that the president do more to resolve the ongoing civil rights issue, with Kennedy sadly admitting that his late brother had not done quite enough to truly finish the job.\n\nWhile not necessarily opposed to this, President Johnson knew that extending the reach of civil rights legislation would not sit well with the more conservative Democrats and may well drive some of them to the Far-Right NPP. As such, the two men debated for many hours, with Johnson expressing his concerns and Kennedy attempting to offer workable compromises, but never straying from that one main demand. In the end, the two men agreed to a deal which they felt was reasonably suitable for the both of them, with President Johnson agreeing to Kennedy's core demands in exchange for some concessions. It remains to be seen if the party will be as approving of the deal, however."
 LBJ.4.a:0 "Let's hope the Dixiecrats don't yell too much."

 LBJ.5.t:0 "Fury in the Democrats"
 LBJ.5.desc:0 ""That our president would so readily capitulate to the demands of our opponents in the interest of furthering his own cause is a national disgrace! The NPP has no place in this ruling coalition, that I might remind all here today is a coalition between the Republican party and the Democratic party. If President Johnson continues down this path, I cannot say in good faith that I can support the union between our parties any longer, and I am sure many of my fellow Democrats can agree."\n\nThese were the words spoken with barely contained anger by Democratic senator Wallace F. Bennett today, and true to his word, they were echoed by many within the party. The agreement between President Johnson and Kennedy's Center NPP has drawn the ire of the Democrats, who see the president's intent to deal with the Center over his own Democratic partners as an act of betrayal. In addition, his promise to review the civil rights issue has reportedly led some of the more conservative senators to quietly exchange words with the Far-Right wing of the NPP, perhaps considering whether they may find better leadership and representation under their banner.\n\nThis newest internal crisis is fast becoming yet another hurdle for President Johnson's plans for the country. While some note that he is certainly shaking up a largely stagnant political theatre, the reality for the president is much more of a headache. With the smaller but nonetheless significant half of his party threatening an outright break from their coalition, he will need to find a way to either placate the Democrats or else keep them in line if he wants his young presidency to maintain the power to do what he feels is necessary."

 LBJ.6.t:0 "The Johnson Treatment"
 LBJ.6.desc:0 "In the last few days, President Johnson has been hard at work attempting to smooth over the rift between the Democrats and himself. In a mixture of private talks and public speeches, he has engaged in a fierce charm offensive, utilizing his political charisma to convince his fellow politicians that he is on their side. He has made it clear that though he fully intends to work with the Center NPP to pass some crucial reforms, he firmly believes that the bond between the Republicans and Democrats is more important than ever, and he will do whatever it takes to ensure that this bond is maintained.\n\nHowever, Johnson has also taken a more aggressive and assertive attitude to some of the more stubborn Democrats who still see him as unworthy of leading them. Often bringing up the fact that the Democrats popularity still hasn't recovered since the loss of the Second World War, Johnson has subtly reminded the Democrats that their party would have been consigned to irrelevancy by now had the Republican-Democrat coalition not been established. This combined with some other rather bullish statements, some of which could be construed as mild threats towards certain senators, has rendered some of the loudest opponents within the party notably silent in recent days.\n\nFor the time being it seems the Democrats have been calmed, and President Johnson's deal with the Center NPP now draws little more consternation than wild speculation from the media. While the drama may have abated, however, it has clearly revealed that cracks are beginning to show in the Republican-Democrats. The party survives for now, but who can say what the future holds?"

President Lyndon Baines Johnson sits in his chair, reading and signing other important documents.

"But President Johnson, isn't that what you intend to do? Was that not your entire campaign platform? To reform the American political system and create a 'great society'?"\n\n"In due time, Walt," replied Johnson, signing another document and setting it aside.\n\n"So you're going to break your deal with the Democrats later on?"\n\n"Maybe," he said, "or maybe they'll fall in line and vote with us anyway. Maybe I'll get enough votes to ignore them and go ahead with my plans."\n\n"All due respect, sir, but I don't think that the Democrats will just let you do that. They'll cause a big fuss."\n\n"Have you ever tried to calm a panicking horse, or, more pertinently, a mule? You need to approach slowly, and only go around the back when you're sure it trusts you. Politics is much the same. For right now, we're still on the approach."\n\n"That might work, but what if it doesn't?"\n\n"One thing at a time," Johnson replied, "for the moment, they'll have to hug our elephant, and I'll have to kiss their ass.""

In any case, we're going to have to make this brief, Johnson, I have a lot of things to do. Spend long enough in here and people will start to notice, too. What do you need?"\n\nJohnson sat down at the beautiful table across from Jackson. "I'm going to need your help," he began, "the Democrats won't be complacent with my reforms forever, and when they turn, I'll need Center-NPP votes."\n\n"What's in it for us? Why should I help you sway the Center?"\n\n"Why shouldn't you is a better question; by supporting my reforms, you get everything you've been begging for and more."\n\n"And what exactly have we been 'begging for'?"\n\n"Civil Rights, universal healthcare, greater social security, and about a hundred other things."\n\nJackson pondered for a moment. "If I'm going to help you, you have to help me. Any bill the Center calls for, I want your support."\n\n"Hmm... alright. I can't promise the Republicans will follow suit, but I'll throw you a bone when you want one."\n\n"Excellent," replied Jackson, smiling, "I think we're going to get a lot done together, Mr. President.""

What do you need?"\n\nWalter Jenkins shuffled in his seat. "We've gotta make a choice, Mr. President," he said, "if we want to pass some of our reforms. We can make friends with the Democrats, or we can press the Far Right. Nobody else has the votes to secure a majority with us; the Center are notoriously unreliable, as I'm sure you're aware."\n\n"We're already making friends with the Democrats, aren't we?" asked Johnson.\n\n"Yes," Muskie began, "but they're proving pretty stubborn, if we want their support we'll have to make genuine concessions to them."\n\n"Alright. What exactly do you mean by 'press the Far Right'?"\n\n"Intimidation, blackmail, that sort of thing."\n\n"Hmm," said Johnson, scratching his chin, "what do you think, Muskie?"\n\n"Personally? I don't think the Far Right will cave as easily as we think. Democrats are the way to go."\n\n"I'll make the call.""

This news comes as a shock to the nation at large, but most of all to the Deep South, where the FR-NPP has their greatest amount of support. Senator Strom Thurmond, generally considered to be the leader of the FR-NPP within the Senate, had this to say: "I am greatly heartened by the spirit of cooperation and compromise within this newly-elected administration. President Johnson and I, along with a great number of our colleagues, have managed to agree upon a new economic reform plan that seeks to please all parties. The President will have his Great Society, and I will stand behind him."\n\nPresident Johnson has yet to make more than a passing comment upon the deal with the Far Right, but many expect that he and the R-D's have made some sort of compromise, sacrificing some of their reforms in exchange for support in Congress. As of right now, the changes agreed upon to the President's legislation have not been released, and the nation waits with bated breath, watching this unprecedented alliance form."

"I thought we'd figured that out a long time ago."\n\n"Things have changed, Ed," Johnson replied, "we've made compromises to get the support that we have. Now, what are the major things that we could get away with? I won't give up the Civil Rights push. Kennedy died for it and I won't let his death be in vain. More than just voting security as well-- I want the whole racist, institutionalized disease ripped out, root and stem."\n\n"Fair enough," said Rockefeller, "I could probably get that through without much issue. I think we should throw in some anti-poverty legislation, too. We're still in a recession, Johnson. I'm not sure what the bills would precisely entail but we should probably include them."\n\n"Fair enough.

In a speech given during a guest appearance at the University of Michigan, Johnson laid out the ways his project would tackle poverty, racial injustice, education, healthcare and transportation, amongst other aspects of American society in need of reform. Vowing to overhaul the country "in our cities, in our countryside and in our classrooms," the President expressed his firm belief that the Great Society is exactly what our country needs in these trying times.\n\nHis speech drew applause from those in attendance and from many within the Republican-Democrats, however his plans are not without opposition. With the war in South Africa still raging on, many question whether America can afford the President's proposed programs on top of the money vanishing into that quagmire. In addition, some voices within the Far-Right NPP and the Democrats murmur that many of Johnson's initiatives would be a gross overreach of government authority, with at least one Far-Right senator reportedly denouncing him as a "power hungry proto-fascist."\n\nFor the next few months, President Johnson intends to pass a myriad of bills aimed at implementing his vision. This will be a long, arduous process, and it will certainly be necessary to cut more deals to secure the support necessary to pass these bills. Regardless, he believes that no task is too much if it shall render American society truly great."

 LBJ.13.t:0 "Debating the Voting Rights Act"
 LBJ.13.desc:0 "Today, Congress has convened to discuss the terms on the bill of our proposed Voting Rights Act. This bill is designed to provide general provisions for the prohibition of racial discrimination in local and state-level voting. Despite fierce opposition from the Far-Right NPP and muffled grumbling within the Democrats, we have managed to decide on a number of these provisions already. This includes forbidding the implementation of any sort of voting qualification, prerequisite or any other act of interference against a person's right to vote on the basis of race, color or language.\n\nA debate has arisen on the matter of certain special provisions that may be added to the bill. These provisions include legally requiring all jurisdictions to provide election materials to voters in multiple languages, allowing federal oversight in any state or local level change to election laws, and the appointment of federal examiners to oversee voter registration functions to make sure the provisions are being implemented. The debate has grown fierce, with the Far-Right NPP and some Democrats arguing these provisions amount to federal tyranny, while the Center NPP insists that they are absolutely necessary to protect the voting rights of America's most vulnerable. Many within the Republicans meanwhile argue that a compromise would be best, allowing some special provisions in return for some conservative amendments.\n\nHow strong these provisions are, if they are implemented at all, will need to be decided before we can take the bill to vote. Too many provisions and the Democrats are likely to complain, too few and the Center will not be happy. What course shall we take?"

 LBJ.14.desc:0 "Over the past few days, in a dramatic but unsurprising series of events, the South and its Far Right NPP population have descended into what can kindly be called utter chaos. Dozens of protests have been organized all across the former Confederacy, in cities such as Atlanta, Montgomery, New Orleans, and Savannah. All of this anger can be attributed to two men, in particular: Senator Strom Thurmond, and Alabama Governor George Wallace. These two individuals have riled up the white population against President Lyndon Johnson, following recent announcements that his "Great Society" reforms would include comprehensive Civil Rights legislation.\n\nThe Deep South have long been strong followers of the FR-NPP and, to a lesser extent, the more conservative elements of the Democrats. As such, they have always had a reputation for acts of defiance against Civil Rights legislation, but nothing quite to this extent. As of right now, it is unknown why Strom Thurmond and George Wallace have promoted such extreme protest, and only time will tell if it has any true impact on the President's decisions.\n\nThe President himself, despite the furious Southern protestations, has declared that "a Great Society includes equality for all individuals, regardless of race, color, or creed". He has dismissed the protests as nothing more than "the Far Right wishing it had true influence". It would appear that the stubborn Republican president will hold his ground against Southern rage, but Congress may not."

 LBJ.15.desc:0 "Protests are breaking out across the nation, especially outside of the South, as President Lyndon Johnson's landmark Civil Rights bill takes effect. The act, passed by the Senate last Sunday, was far more conservative than was expected from such a liberal president. It provided only moderate protections for the voting rights of African Americans, and provisions for a very slow desegregation process. Overall, the more liberal and progressive elements of the nation are in an uproar, but none more so than the Center-NPP.\n\nCenter-NPP leaders, including Former Presidential Candidate Robert F. Kennedy and Senator Scoop Jackson, have both decried the passing of President Johnson's bill, and commanded their supporters to "not stop pushing for true equality". They claim, among other things, that the new bill simply weakens the pro-Civil Rights movement by making its more moderate followers content, while no real issues are truly solved. When pressed for comment, President Johnson simply dismissed the protests as "angered radicals whining over a compromise that works for everyone" and that "the Great Society includes equal rights, but also requires healthy, stable transitions into that equality"."

The bill, which saw a fierce vote in the Senate between the Progressives and the Far Right and Republicans, has widely been criticized by the former for its lack of deep protections for African Americans and their disadvantaged communities.\n\nIt now appears that many African Americans share that sentiment, as tens of thousands began demonstrating early this morning, calling the President a "traitor", among other names. In many cities however, notably Los Angeles and Birmingham, state governors sent in police and National Guard elements to disperse the protestors. Things became violent quickly, however, with the protestors using improvised weapons to fight back, as well as makeshift shields made from hubcaps and trash can covers to block the fire hoses the police attempted to disperse them with. By the end of the day, hundreds of shops, cars, and public buildings had been vandalized or burned.\n\nFighting appears to have been worst in Birmingham, where it appears that the local chapter of the Klu Klux Klan involved themselves when the demonstrations became violent. The Klansmen formed a temporary alliance with the police chief in charge of the operation, and soon came down upon the protestors with clubs and other weapons. Now, with most of the Birmingham riot concluded, at least 19 people, 12 of them African American, are confirmed dead."

However, it has come to the attention of our administration that in many cities across America, the segregated areas remain due to extreme police prejudice; that African Americans are still forced into lower class status due to the strength of the lawmen who were commanded to protect them. Additionally, there have been claims that certain discriminatory, supremacist organizations have infiltrated many municipal police departments. After so many reports from so many sources, it is my opinion that immediate action must be taken to rectify this issue. As such, our administration will be moving to reshuffle suspect police forces, mandate heavier background checks and screening measures for new officers, and break up the bonds between many law enforcement agencies and third party elements, such as the Klu Klux Klan."\n\nAlready, the move has drawn criticism from the South, most notably from Alabama Governor George Wallace, who called President Johnson a "tyrant" for "his infringement upon the rights of states to enforce their own laws". It would appear that many politicians of the Far Right wing of the National Progressive Party are moving to block any legislation that the Johnson Administration can introduce to regulate municipal police. As it stands, it appears that if the President wishes to see his desires realized, he may have to do it through executive order."

Something's not working and we need to determine what it is."\n\n"My recommended course of action is to break up the police departments at the core," said Katzenbach, "senior and junior officers need to be more separated, and suspect departments should have full federal investigations placed onto them."\n\n"Let's not push this too far," said Barnett, "too much pressure and you might be facing a case in the Supreme Court. The current stress you're putting on them is more than enough, it just needs time to sort itself out."\n\n"Fine then," sighed Katzenbach.\n\n"I think we should put some additional measures on, just a bit lighter, perhaps. The discrimination is supposed to be bad in Georgia. I'll call up Governor Garland Byrd and tell him how we want to get his state in line-- he won't refuse the President, even if he has proven difficult in the past.

Wallace called upon all Southern States to resist any such requests by the federal government.\n\nPro-police organizations have gathered in many cities across the South in support of Wallace's rallying cry. Governor of Georgia, Lester Maddox, however, has commented little on the government suggestions as of yet, only saying he will not implement them. The South, it appears, will not bow to the Johnson Administration's new Civil Rights enforcement methods. What this means for the future is impossible to say, but the National Progressive Party holds strong majorities in the South; majorities which seem here to stay.\n\nThe President himself was unavailable for comment on Governor Wallace's actions, but Attorney General Nicholas Katzenbach had this to say: "Mister Wallace's claim, that the United States federal government is overstepping its constitutional bounds with this mandate, is simply unfounded.

Following a rebellious comment made by Alabama Governor George Wallace last week- one that many found offensive to African Americans and Civil Rights as a whole. Tens of thousands have poured out in protest in many major cities across the South, including Birmingham, Jackson, Atlanta, and New Orleans. These people are coming out not only against Wallace's statement, but also the Johnson Administration for allowing southern states to refuse additional regulations.\n\nAs with prior Civil Rights demonstrations in the South, the protestors have come into conflict with municipal police forces, as well as local chapters of the Klu Klux Klan, in many cases. With violence dragging on into the afternoon, at least two hundred people have been injured, with around 34 dead. In several cities, such as Atlanta, the National Guard has been forced to step in and cease violence, with moderate success.\n\nSo far, responses from Governor Wallace or the Johnson Administration have been scarce, at best. Wallace has given only a few comments calling the protestors "a band of hooligans", before ordering the National Guard to restore order in some cities. President Johnson, on the other hand, has given no response whatsoever, with many White House sources claiming that he has secluded himself in the Oval Office, requesting not to be disturbed."

In many cities, the protests became violent, taking a long time before either calming down or being stopped by local National Guard units.\n\nSenator Strom Thurmond called the week of protests an "assault on law and order", with Governor of Mississippi Ross Barnett calling it "the Days of Rage"-- a term now popular across much of the nation. Now, even the original anti-discrimination measures proposed by the Johnson Administration are being ignored in the South. The Klu Klux Klan seems to be openly working with local authorities, and hate crimes have skyrocketed. Overall, the past few weeks have proven disastrous for the President and the Republican Party, and Johnson will likely see much more emboldened resistance from the South in the future."

While the gears of justice move slowly, and not all of the cases will be decided in the government's favor, there is a growing outcry throughout the South that the Feds are overstepping their authority, trying to criminalize personal opinions and thoughts, trampling the First Amendment and dismantling State's Rights. One particular case, where a hotel owner in Georgia was arrested for allowing a white mob to break into a black man's room, tie him up, smash his belongings and threaten to lynch him, has become the focal point of this opposition, with Yockey's faction of the NPP denouncing the FBI's case, arguing it was overstepping their authority when the state courts could have handled this (and, undoubtedly, let the white hotel owner and the mob to walk free).

It appears Governor Maddox of Georgia and Governor Wallace of Alabama are also standing down, allowing the old federal rules to be enforced once more.\n\nThe period of violence, often called the "Days of Rage", led to weeks of violence between protestors and pro-police elements all across the South. These pro-police elements often consisted of the police themselves, as well as members of the white supremacist Klu Klux Klan. All told, over 60 Americans died during the fighting, with more than 1000 injured or hospitalized.\n\nIt appears the Johnson Administration, with the violence concluded, is moving to once again enforce its desegregation rules upon the South.

 LBJ.60.desc:0 "Lyndon Baines Johnson sat in the Oval Office, the rare pleasure of pure, unabashed silence consuming the room. Paper after paper, meeting after meeting: the day had been a long one, and the Sun was just now caressing the western horizon. Suddenly, the door creaked open, and through it entered Vice President Edmund Muskie; the two proposals for a new immigration bill had been finally finished. "Democrat written," said Muskie, placing the one down in front of Johnson. "Republican written," he said, placing the other.\n\nJohnson exchanged no words with Muskie; he simply sat, scanning his eyes through the Democrat written immigration bill. It was very long, very thorough, and very restrictive. Immigration quotas would be increased, but upheld; travel to the United States from Germany and Japan would remain heavily restricted; and it would only slightly lessen requirements on applying for a visa. In short, it was extremely conservative, as he expected it to be. Technically, it wasn't even totally written by Democrats- the Republicans had a part in writing it as well- but the Dems always did have a tendency to drown out others.\n\nNext, Johnson flipped through the Republican proposal. At this point, it was just a rough draft- still subject to significant future revision- but the groundwork and basic contents were there. Johnson found it to be much more amiable to his plans than the previous one. If implemented, the bill would remove immigration quotas entirely; open up travel to and from Germany, Japan, and other foreign powers; and generally lessen restrictions on entering the United States, which have been very strict since the end of the Second World War.\n\n"Which one are we gonna move forward with?" asked Edmund Muskie. "If we go ahead with the Democrat proposal, we'll probably garner some more votes with it, so it's more assured. Our proposal, on the other hand, is much more in-line with our policies and campaign promises, but it'll be harder to push through Congress and the Democrats will consider it a slap in the face.""

As Germany had fallen to pieces around him, he fled from his university dormitory to Denmark, and then to Scotland. For more than a year he had bided his time in Scotland, struggling to learn English, drifting from job to job, and desperately seeking an entry visa into the United States.\n\nHans' wish finally came true with President Lyndon Johnson's new immigration bill, which, after decades of hostility, allowed German nationals to enter the United States. Of course, one still had to obtain a visa, but no longer was travel to America limited to the rich or the powerful in Germany; now, even poor little Hans could pop onto a ship to a new world for a new life.\n\nThe barge was reeled into port on the north side of Manhattan. Walking down the plank onto the concrete dock, the Hudson River at his back, and the wind in his hair, he had finally arrived. America! The stench of ocean salt and garbage and industrial pollutants dominated the air, but Hans could care less. It was less the smell of refuse and more the taste of liberty.\n\n"Hey, you!" \n\nHans turned around to see a greasy-looking dock worker with jet black hair and a distinct accent talking to him. "Ya just gonna stand there or can we gets to work unloadin' this boat?"\n\n"I'm sorry," replied Hans in his thickly-accented English, "I just arrived from... Sweden.

 LBJ.81.t:0 "Assessment of the Teachers' Unions"
 LBJ.81.desc:0 "One of the planned landmark pieces of legislation President Johnson hopes to pass is the so-called Elementary and Secondary Education Act. While the draft is still rough, ESEA will increase federal funding to schools across the board, as well as focus on parental involvement in public education. While his allies in Congress craft the bill itself and marshal congressional support to ensure its easy passage, the president himself has elected to meet with the most powerful teachers' unions in the country to ensure their support for his newest initiatives.\n\n One of the most notable demands with the unions is to relax federal control over the methods by which teachers may engage with students and teach coursework in the classroom. There has already been some strong opposition to such a proposal, as it may allow "dissident" and "un-American" ideas to proliferate among young children and teenagers in our schools. Furthermore, promising such a reform may weaken our support among conservative Democrats and the staunchest anti-communists and -fascists. Others, however, posit that it may be a new radical step in allowing personalization of education, tailored toward the individual needs of students, and may overall improve the quality of education of our young people."

 LBJ.82.t:0 "Complaints of Federal Overreach"
 LBJ.82.desc:0 "Though Head Start has proven pretty popular among both the general populace and among policymakers at every level of government, President Johnson has come under increasing assault by conservatives -- many even within his own party -- that accuse him of tyranny for having overstepped his bounds for his plans to greatly expand the mandate and scope of the federal government.\n\n Several southern governors, backed by their state legislatures, and supported by numerous federal Congressmen, have demanded that the president guarantee certain privileges in education that will belong to the states and the states only, in an effort to stem the tide of what they have termed "increasing federal overreach bordering on federal tyranny." The president's supporters, as well as northern liberals, have urged Johnson to push forward in his program, criticism be damned.\n\n Thus, determined as ever, President Johnson has continued to forge ahead on his legislative agenda. The Southern Democrats, and conservatives generally within the party, are none too pleased."

 LBJ.83.t:0 "Material Provisions"
 LBJ.83.desc:0 "The final stages of debate surrounding ESEA have begun: how much money should be committed to the program? The growing coalition of conservatives who find themselves increasingly opposed to the president's education policies have requested a more watered-down appropriations commitment in the bill. Lessening the strain on the federal budget can allow for improved budgets for the Department of Defense, or simply stave off any risk of budgetary default in the future.\n\nThe president's allies in the Congress believe it is wholly likely for the bill to pass even with a stronger financial commitment to primary and secondary education. The question is whether the president wishes to further strain his relations with the powerful conservative lobby within his party\n\nFor Johnson's part, he would sooner scatter the most virulent opponents to his agenda to the four winds. But, as Johnson learned in all his years in the Senate, sometimes, in politics, other considerations must be made."

 LBJ.84.desc:0 "Rain fell down in great sheets over Washington. "Lyndon, I cannot, in good conscience, allow this bill."\n\nPresident Johnson's hands were in his pockets, his gaze out on the South Lawn. A peal of thunder in the distance briefly overwhelmed the soft patter of rain on the windows of the Oval Office. Senator Russell was here again, voicing his concerns over the administration's agenda. "With all respect, Lyndon, you must take care to respect the wishes of those constituents throughout the South -- and not just mine in Georgia. A great number of good people do not think dumping millions into this program will do much to improve the welfare of these negro children--"\n\nJohnson suddenly drew himself up, his eyes alight. He snapped on his heels and briskly walked up to Russell, planting himself right in front of him. Their noses were an inch apart; the buttons on their jackets were touching. His voice boomed. "Senator, I do not give a rat's ass about those damn constituents! I have not met with every member of the Congress, held meetings with twenty teachers' unions across the entire country, crafting this bill to perfection -- just to be told 'no' by a few bigots voting for a party to which I owe no allegiance!" Russell froze, his lips tight, his eyes staring into the president's. There was a moment of silence. Calmly, Johnson continued. "Senator, I would ask you kindly to relay to your colleagues that my position on this is final. That is all."\n\n"Okay, Lyndon. As you wish." Johnson turned back around, walking past the Resolute Desk, again staring back out the rain-drenched window.\n\n"And you will address me as Mister President.""

 LBJ.90.t:0 "Funding for Public Schools"
 LBJ.90.desc:0 "A massive first draft of the so-called Higher Education Act was strewn about on the president's desk. Johnson's glasses hung low on his nose, his hand at his forehead, the other gripping page ninety-six of the document. He had been reading and editing and re-reading for hours now --  he wasn't quite sure how long. This draft was what he had asked for, all right -- and it was going to be a damned nightmare to push through the Congress.\n\nAfter the rigmarole the conservatives threw the president through over the writing and passage of ESEA, it is indeed very likely that HEA will receive sharp criticism from budget hawks in the Congress. Furthermore, directly aiding many colleges could possibly be viewed as favoritism. With party relations such as they are, committing to the funding plank could very well cause irreparable damage. If such damage were significant enough, the president's own chances at re-election could be jeopardized. However, Johnson's staunchest allies and supporters insist he commit to the university aid program on principle, arguing that the electoral drawback from doing so would be minimal at worst, and nonexistent at best.\n\nJohnson drew his red pen and marked out a line on the paper. "No, this won't do," he muttered to himself, scribbling a correction in the margin.\n\nThen again, not everyone could be pleased, and an effort in trying to please everyone was an effort wasted."

 LBJ.91.t:0 "Public College Scholarships"
 LBJ.91.desc:0 "The second plank of HEA is an expansion of federally-provided scholarships to distinguished students applying for college admittance. This part of the bill would be far less controversial, and would be more likely to engender more broad support across party lines, barring disagreement over the minutiae of who is chosen to receive the scholarships, how they are administered, and how much the scholarships would be worth.\n\nThe primary concern with this bill is the same as always: the financial burdens of the federal government grow with each year, and budgetary concerns must be considered when bringing all proposals to the table. Aside from the extremists basing their arguments on racial logic, most opposition to HEA is organizing around rhetoric arguing for financial considerations. The educational debates being as fierce as they have been, it could ultimately be best to avoid such a commitment, and to move on to the next item on the Great Society agenda."
 LBJ.91.a:0 "No burden is too great to ensure the survival and success of liberty."
 LBJ.91.b:0 "We need not bury the government further under spending it cannot afford."

 LBJ.94.t:0 "The Compromise Draft"
 LBJ.94.desc:0 "After days and weeks of intensive negotiations over the proposed Social Security Act, enough Democratic lawmakers have been convinced to support a "Compromise draft" for the rest to fall in line. This piece of legislation, while broadly similar to the unmodified bill, contains changes that narrow its scope somewhat. Payments have been reduced across all programs, provisions put in to make sure information about the programs reaches all eligible citizens have been gutted, and the clauses on Family Assistance have been rewritten to apply only to married couples. Many in the administration believe the "Compromise draft" as written amounts to an exclusion of some of the people in most dire need of assistance. Still, its passage has the potential to be a major victory for President Johnson and his choice to emphasize party unity on the matter.\n\n There is, however, another price to be paid. A source of great consternation among the Democratic wing must be removed. The President must sever his alliance with "Scoop" Jackson and the NPP-C. The administrations have sent out feelers for possible alternative compromises, but all their suggestions have been rejected. The Democrats have made up their minds, and no amount of further negotiation, backroom dealing, appeals to party unity or outright bullying tactics will change them.\n\n The president has a choice to make."

 LBJ.95.t:0 "Hopes dashed"
 LBJ.95.desc:0 "The end of the short-lived alliance between President Johnson and "Scoop" Jackson is the topic of every conversation in the National Progressive Party, and will likely continue to be for some time. Jackson had staked a lot of prestige on their association, which had been considered a major victory within the party, proof of their ability to influence policy making on the highest level. \n\n The NPP-C leadership had hoped they would now act as a counterweight to the conservative wing of the R-Ds, and that they could leverage that position to make policy gains. The passage of a substantial Social Security Act would be a crowning achievement, ushering a new era for the country and securing the NPP-C a seat at the table for the foreseeable future. When the President chose instead to cave to the demands of that very same conservative wing and end his association with Jackson, and then to pass a watered down bill, it felt to many in the party like they were relegated, again, to the sidelines.\n\n Jackson's disappointment was plain to all when he publicly decried the Compromise Bill as "a victim, in my opinion, of putting party before country", which "denies support and opportunity to those Americans most in need of it". This gloominess does not extend, however, to the Far Right faction, whose lawmakers have made their approval of the revisions in the bill no secret. Their celebratory mood is beginning to give rise to considerable resentment in the rest of the party, once again calling into question the viability of an alliance between such a strange set of bedfellows."

 LBJ.96.t:0 "Toeing the Party Line"
 LBJ.96.desc:0 "No-one in the White House or the Halls of Congress could avoid sensing the recent shift in atmosphere. Relations between the main wings of the Republican-Democratic Party are at a low, with accusations of putting personal agendas ahead of party unity and stability abounding behind closed doors, and a relationship that was never warm in the first place is cooling further.\n\n The latest fault-line is the passage of the Social Security Act, which is clearly more important to the president than keeping the Democratic wing of his party content. Great effort has been expended in recruiting every supporter of the Act in pressuring, badgering and bullying its detractors into submission. Most of the Democratic lawmakers have fallen in line, seemingly judging that they still have too much to lose if they publicly speak out against their party.\n\n For many Democratic voters, however, this is taken as another instance of the Republican wing happily taking their votes while ignoring their interests, feeding a growing sense of disenfranchisement with the party. Also feeding that sense are the firebrands of the NPP Far Right, who are finding a waiting audience for their condemnations of "the Socialist-in-Chief" and his "attacks on the white working man of America"."

Henry "Scoop" Jackson has spoken warmly of the bill on multiple occasions, and this morning he contacted the administration on behalf of a group of senators from the NPP-C. They are pledging their votes to ensure the passing of the Social Security Act in its current, comprehensive state.\n\n President Johnson is hailing their support as proof of the broad appeal of the Act and an important victory for the Great Society. Jackson, on his part, explains his support of the Act and willingness to cross the aisle to pass it as proof of his "commitment to America and the welfare of the common man.""

The Act passed through congress without major revision, and will cast a strong, wide, social security net for Americans for years to come. Henry "Scoop" Jackson has hailed the bill as a "triumph of bipartisan cooperation" and "a great victory for the people of the United States". \n\n Within the RD. It is very clear now that President Johnson's progressives are in the ascendancy, with conversations and planning focusing almost exclusively on how to build on their recent victory and little energy being spent on soothing ruffled feathers or bringing the Democratic wing back into the conversation. Among Democratic senators, a sense of unease is growing as they find the centre of gravity in the party moving further and further away from them, with little opportunity to correct its course lest they be cut off from decision-making entirely. This unease extends to their voters. In traditional Democratic strongholds, many are questioning their commitment to a party that they increasingly find themselves at the margins of."

 LBJ.100.desc:0 "Mr. President, the Great Society is starting to be put into effect. And good news: the overwhelming majority of Americans support our efforts to reform society to make it more equal and fair for those on the bottom of the totem pole. But as our efforts bear fruit in Congress, there are already rumbles of opposition building. Some conservatives in the Democratic wing of the party, as well as the FR-NPP, are starting to complain in private, and there are anonymous op-eds in newspapers all over the nation denouncing the efforts.\n\n There is really nothing to be worried about now: most of these people would never have voted for the Great Society anyway if it wasn't political suicide to support the first acts that are generally popular with the American people. The few that did vote against these acts did so on grounds of high cost, and the encroachment into the state's prerogatives, and not necessarily in regard to the ideas themselves.\n\n In general, our plans are moving ahead, and still have wide support, so we should be able to continue pushing forward to make America a better, more equal nation."

 LBJ.101.desc:0 "Mr. President, we've gotten more of the Great Society passed through Congress with the wide ranging majorities and support that these proposals and ideas have been receiving in polls for the past few months. In general, the people are with us, and Congress, including the R-D's and much of the NPP, are still supportive, so we can expect the bipartisan support needed to get more through.\n\n That said, some of the more conservative and moderate members of the Republican-Democrats are talking to staffers on Capitol Hill, and are feeling like we've already done a good job, and should maybe start winding down the Great Society. One Senator even said that we've done enough for this decade, and should let the next generation get a chance to do some stuff! \n\n While no one is breaking away and refusing to go along, we will most likely start seeing more resistance from the Democrats, and even some of the moderate Republicans, who believe that the Great Society has gone far enough. Any further Great Society acts could start arousing concerns of everything they like to worry about, like tax hikes, debt, socialism, and states rights. So we should take this into consideration as we go forward."

Some Democrats voted against the last bill, some of those conservatives that like "small government" and "pulling yourself up by your bootstraps" and all that. While it wasn't enough to threaten the passing of these laws, it does mean that future laws will most likely require that we work with the Center faction of the National Progressive Party to ensure that we have enough support to pass through an increasingly divided Congress.\n\n You should know as well as I do that this could be a problem: the Republican-Democrats were formed to keep the peace and stability of America first and foremost.

Many of the right-leaning Democrats are openly starting to back away from you and the party, denouncing our efforts as centralizing the government and "Bukharinism." Some congressmen are even crossing the aisle to the NPP. While most of them didn't like the Great Society in general, their leaving deals a blow to make your policies seem, at least on the surface, somewhat bipartisan.\n\n On top of that, now the Republicans are starting to warm to the whole Great Society, but are starting to push us to go even further, make the plans more ambitious. They are really starting to sound like Harringinton, or Robert Kennedy...\n\n Hey now, don't throw that pen at me! I know you don't like RFK, but take it up with the Republicans.

But those numbers are just barely above the majority, and we are facing an internal political maelstrom: The Republican-Democrat Party is crumbling as we speak. Already, several big named Democrats have denounced us, and are crossing over to the NPP-FR.

I'm here to tell you what is and what isn't good for your political standing. I know the Great Society is great for America, and I will do what I can to get it passed. But with the party buckling, and the sides getting more partisan and restless, I don't know how much more I can do within the party.\n\n We are going to have to rely on the progressives of the Republican party and NPP-C to keep passing Great Society legislation, which should be enough to get it through Congress.

Fears that have been stoked by the Democrats and the NPP-FR about higher taxes and more government control of their lives are starting to filter through the public. While the numbers of people who support the Great Society overall are still strong, we should be prepared to face growing backlash as we expand it.\n\n There are commentators and political scientists that are talking increasingly of the new polarization of American society, all revolving around your plans, with progressives on the left pushing to go even further than the Administration wants, and conservatives on the right who are demanding a halt to the growth of government power and interference in the lives of citizens and undermining states rights, and people in the middle who are tired of both extremes.\n\n This is especially evident on the West Coast: while a majority were supportive of the Great Society at the beginning, now support is dropping, and dropping a lot quicker than in other places, namely about the cost. This is only going to get stronger, divide more Americans, and lead to a virtual breakdown of society into an "us vs. them" mentality that will make it even harder to pass further laws."

As the Republicans who are left in the R-D lean more progressive, we are actually lining up with the NPP-C on many social and economic issues, which should help make the Great Society legislation easier to pass and promote.\n\n Of course, there are going to be issues with working with the NPP-C: they are much more established leftists and progressives than most Republicans, so the future proposals will lean even more toward them, and bolster their own support in future elections. There are even some Democrats calling you the first NPP President as we continue to work with them.\n\n Politics has always made for strange bedfellows, and working with some of the folks on the other side of the aisle is, well, strange and discomforting at times. But at least working with Micheal Harrington and Scoop Jackson is a lot easier, more pleasant, and less migraine inducing than with Barry Goldwater or Wallace Bennett.

Just that small number can make or break elections: just a few thousand votes in the right state can make all the difference.\n\n Oh yes, and the other number: the NPP-L are also gaining a boost too, and a fairly big one. As the rhetoric is ratcheting up, both opposed and in favor, those on the far left are seeing increasing support as well, seeking to get the Great Society to be even stronger and farther reaching. They are taking support from both the Republicans and even our allies in the NPP-C.\n\n I really don't know what else to tell you.

 LBJ.126.desc:0 "Now that the shape of the Social Security Act is more or less settled, all that remains is to decide upon how to fund it. The projected cost of the programs is substantial, and there is no room to pay for it in the current budget. This means President Johnson and his administration have no other option than to enact new taxes. \n\nThere are two main camps within the administration. The first proposes a new tax on income specifically to support Social Security. While a new tax is never going to be a popular proposition, they believe they can make it easier to swallow for the electorate by framing it as an investment in their own retirement.\n\n The second camp proposes a much wider tax reform. It contains changes to almost every system of tariffs, levies or taxes collected by the federal government, and the increase in revenue will leave us a lot of extra funding even after Social Security is provided for. This reform is certain to prove a very hard sell to the public, but the increase in funds gives the administration a lot of financial room to act going forward, and will all but guarantee we won't have to raise taxes again in the foreseeable future."
 LBJ.126.a:0 "The first option. We just need to fund Social Security"
 LBJ.126.b:0 "The second option. We need the money"

 LBJ.128.t:0 "Equality for All?"
 LBJ.128.desc:0 "It's been a stain on America's founding vision from the start, the outcome of the United States' original sin: that African Americans have been seen as inferior to the White man. Recent events in the South, where police officers have brutally assaulted a black man, which made the news across the nation, have pushed President Johnson and his allies in Congress to start putting together a program that will change the balance, to give racially oppressed minorities the rights that the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution legally gives them, but for far too long has been ignored. This program would encourage business, academia, the civil service and others to hire more African Americans, as well as Indians, Latinos, Asians and other minority groups to be more representative of the population as a whole.\n\nOf course, there are some that strongly disagree; claiming that the Black man is already equal in law, and that Civil Rights has gone too far, that this as yet unnamed program would make Blacks more powerful than whites. The opposition has coalesced around Francis Parker Yockey and his right wing supporters in the NPP, which has seen a boost in support in polls lately."
 LBJ.128.a:0 "The scales are only being tipped to make it more equal."

 LBJ.129.t:0 "Growing Socialism"
 LBJ.129.desc:0 "To some of our detractors, measures taken to implement the Great Society border on socialism. Yet to the NPP-L, this is a good thing - and moreover, they're the ones responsible for it, by "putting pressure on the Johnson Presidency to actually enact laws which will help the working class". Not very convincing, but the Left is taking the credit anyway, and piggy backing on our success to grow their own movement."
 LBJ.129.a:0 "Is there really a place for socialism in America?"

 LBJ.130.t:0 "Working on Healthcare"
 LBJ.130.desc:0 "Rumors and leaks have been coming from the Administration that work toward the budget for a universal healthcare plan is currently ongoing. While the Press Secretary and the President himself won't say so officially, speculation is growing in Washington and around the country that soon the US will join virtually every other industrialized nation on the planet for a full and comprehensive medical insurance plan. While there is still a long way to go before the plan will be presented to the American people, and to convince a majority that it's in their best interest, the Left wing of the National Progressive Party's coalition is already capitalizing on this outcome. Claiming that universal healthcare is thanks almost entirely to their pushing and continuing support, the NPP-L has seen their support increase across the nation already."
 LBJ.130.a:0 "We haven't even finished putting it together yet!"

 LBJ.131.t:0 "Reluctant Republicans"
 LBJ.131.desc:0 "Whilst our administration has only acted in the best interest of the American people, we seem to have gone too far for some within our own party. A number of Republicans have publicly distanced themselves from some of our most recent measures, leading to a decline in support for the President from a segment of the electorate. Unfortunately, this weakens our ability to implement the change America needs."
 LBJ.131.a:0 "Ah, fuck 'em."

 LBJ.132.t:0 "A Great Society"
 LBJ.132.desc:0 "When Lyndon B. Johnson entered the White House in 1964, he entered that office with a promise on his lips. Before America's families and its workers, with God as his witness, and in full sight of a sketpical world, the President had promised a society where no child would go unfed, and no youngster would go unschooled. He had promised an end to racial discrimination, a healthcare system which would provide for America's sick, and an environment for our children to enjoy. For this agenda, President Jonhson has been criticised fiercely from every quarter by those who would be the enemies of change. Yet he pushed on regardless, and however lonely that chair in the Oval Office can get, President Johnson can say he has made the Great Society a reality.\n\nIn the wake of the achievement of our promises, the Republican-Democrats have shown rare signs of improved cohesion. Yet this might prove fleeting. Implementing Johnson's agenda has alienated millions of former R-D voters, who are being wooed by the demagogues of the NPP and their unceasing attacks on our policies. Our own party's unity has been greatly strained by the Johnson agenda, making winning reelection a real challenge. Yet by God, the things we have achieved. We have given the American people hope, more so than they have dared to show in decades. And come what may, that is worth a lot."
 LBJ.132.a:0 "A Great Society for this country, the greatest country in the world."

 LBJ.134.t:0 "The Meeting"
 LBJ.134.desc:0 "President Johnson sat nervously during the entire meeting. Even with the gulf in political power between the two men, Johnson took on a humble and reserved tone when speaking to Martin Luther King Jr. President Johnson explained that he was eager to continue the struggle for Civil Rights and build upon the success of his Voting Rights Act. He said that Rev. King could tell his community that they have no greater friend in the fight for racial equality.\n\n "Indeed, we do not.", Rev. King replied, "and the VRA was a true boon to our community's ability to make their voices heard at the polls. You can count on our support, Mr. President. Yet there's far more work that needs to be done than you may realize. Writing a few laws is easy, but solving the entrenched social inequality that the Black community faces in this country cannot be accomplished without fighting against the endemic poverty we face. The evils of racism, economic exploitation and militarism are all tied together... you can't really get rid of one without getting rid of the others... the whole structure of American life must be changed.\n\n Rev. King continued, "You can't talk about solving the economic problem of the Negro without talking about billions of dollars. You can't talk about ending the slums without first saying profit must be taken out of slums. You're really tampering and getting on dangerous ground because you are messing with folk then. You are messing with captains of industry. Now this means that we are treading in difficult water, because it really means that we are saying that something is wrong with capitalism. If America does not use her vast resources of wealth to end poverty and make it possible for all of God's children to have the basic necessities of life, she too will go to hell."\n\n President Johnson was guarded in his response, saying that he was committed to fighting the War on Poverty as a key plank of his Great Society program. The President thanked MLK for all his support and the meeting concluded cordially."
 LBJ.134.a:0 "How great can the Great Society become?"

 LBJ.135.t:0 "Gaining the Black Vote"
 LBJ.135.desc:0 "The Republican-Democrats have accomplished one of the most monumental feats in social American history with the passing of the Voting Rights Act. Not only are the African Americans unimpeded on their way to vote, but they are now actively flocking to the polls, greatly increasing the voter turnout. The surge of African American votes is spread throughout the South, not only in the major cities of Birmingham, Atlanta, or Houston, but also in the smaller cities of Little Rock, Jacksonville, Biloxi. The population was even gaining ground in the poor rural areas of Central Alabama and the outskirts of the huge Georgia cities.\n\nBut Lyndon B. Johnson was hard at work today. It was inevitable that with proper representation, African Americans would go to the polls in huge numbers to show support for the party of their choosing. If Johnson could garner the African American vote, it is possible that the RDs could become the dominant party in the South, displacing the NPP menace. This vote would make up for all the Dixiecrats that quickly deserted the party once the act was passed. Time was of the essence for President Johnson as he began to dial up activists, church leaders, professors all throughout the Deep South, starting with Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia..."
 LBJ.135.a:0 "We need the African Americans on our side!"

 LBJ.136.t:0 "Winning Over Black America!"
 LBJ.136.desc:0 ""Now, I know that things haven't been going our way since we were first brought to America centuries ago. We suffered under the lash for years and years, not just in the United States, but throughout the entire continent. It was by the will of Abraham Lincoln and by the grace of God that our chains were finally broken. We had some success in American culture; we had Frederick Douglass, we had George Washington Carver, we had Rosa Parks. These people worked to put us in the spotlight. My fellow African Americans, though we still face prejudice, our words now matter. Our vote finally matters. Our lives finally matter."\n\n"Do you know who made this happen? The Republican Party worked day and night to give us this opportunity. Our great President Johnson needs our help more than ever. He worked to give us the proper right to vote, he stopped every oppressive state that tried to lay a hand on us. I say we give back to him, to the Republican Party. If you haven't realized yet, my friends, we need them too. We will accept the President's Great Society with open arms."\n\nAfter several months of campaigning, the Republican Party started to win over some well-known activists to President Johnson's cause. These activists, in turn, reached out to the multitudes of African Americans in the South, persuading them to use their new vote for the party. While some progress has been made down South among the new black voters, there is still a long way to go before the Republicans could ever become relevant in the region."
 LBJ.136.a:0 "At least we're making progress."

 LBJ.137.t:0 "Winning Over Black America!"
 LBJ.137.desc:0 ""Look how the world around us is changing with President Johnson at the helm. We've been given the incredible voting privilege that has eluded us countless times in the past. Our poorer blacks in the South are more likely to afford cheap housing thanks to President Johnson's housing act. The schools for our black children are being given more funds, and they are being recognized for their academic achievements. Our older blacks are receiving the care they so desperately need thanks to the new Medicare program. Folks, I see a lot of potential with the Republican Party after looking around at the Great Society we are living in. If we keep voting Republican, I believe all American lives will get better and better."\n\nOur campaigning is proving to be very successful at gaining the African American vote in the South. The more activists we influence, the more momentum we gather to topple the traditional parties that have dominated the South for decades. We have noted a substantial increase in popularity among blacks in poorer regions, which can only mean that our Great Society is working.\n\nOur campaign has shown some slight flaws: our hardcore traditional whites have started to denounce our platform, claiming that we are "ceding too much to the blacks", but this would come naturally with the addition of new party voters. The issue should not gather enough support to put a dent in our party, but it is something to monitor. Nevertheless, every black voter who once faced oppression at the booth now prepares to defend their newly-given vote with all they have. Our reforms are truly reaching out to all Americans."
 LBJ.137.a:0 "Even more support from the African American community."

 LBJ.138.t:0 "Winning Over Black America!"
 LBJ.138.desc:0 ""Now we have a choice in this next election. We can go with the Republicans, who keep backing us up and will have our back until the end of time, or we can choose the radicals in the NPP who want to tear this country apart and go back to square one. Ultimately it's your choice. But I believe the Republican Party is the right choice to help our country move forward. And with your votes, my brothers and sisters, we will continue the changes that have brought many of us hope and prosperity."\n\nNew polls keep coming in from government agencies, and we are starting to see a rise in popularity the likes of which we have never seen before. It is very likely that with the African American vote, we can turn the South around completely. Even in states like Alabama and South Carolina, where the Republican votes were few and far between, we have started to gain tremendous ground thanks to the large African American populations in these states. However, it would be a lie to say that these states will totally support the Republicans in the next election; already, many Conservative white Americans are expressing their clear disapproval, and they are quickly ditching our party in favor of the dreaded alternative. Our wonderful activists will do more than make up the losses our party suffered, and with their help, we have already gained so many more African Americans to our side. If we keep pushing for change, we will have the entire South in our grasp in no time."
 LBJ.138.a:0 "Awesome"

 LBJ.139.t:0 "A Dream More Than Dreamt!"
 LBJ.139.desc:0 "We put so much effort into passing the reforms that led to President Johnson's "Great Society" and we are finally starting to reap the fruits of our labor. At the end of the day, our carefully-planned policies and our wonderful campaigns have given us a competitive voter base in even the most Conservative regions of the nation. We owe it all to the brave activists that preached our party to the masses of African Americans across the South. We owe it all to President Johnson's government who worked tirelessly to pass legislation that would benefit all Americans regardless of race.\n\nEven now, our work is far from over. Racism is still a widespread issue, and prejudice against Republicans continues as it has since the start of Reconstruction. More white voters have deserted the party during this campaign; in fact, we've lost almost every Dixiecrat member to the NPP. Even with the Republican unity among African Americans, division between blacks and whites is even more apparent.\n\nRegardless, President Johnson's Great Society has improved American healthcare, education, civil rights, and many other important parts of daily life. There is no doubt that the Republican Party will continue gaining lifetime supporters as a result of Lyndon Johnson's successes. Our activists, now working as full-fledged members of the Republican Party, will continue promoting the party that has already helped so many Americans through Johnson's plan."
 LBJ.139.a:0 "The future is bright for the revitalized Republicans."

 LBJ.140.t:0 "Price of Expedience"
 LBJ.140.desc:0 "The good faith among African Americans engendered by President Johnson's attempt to pass substantial housing access reform has been poisoned by his surrender on the issue. Republican's blatantly political reversal on the issue is a spit in the face to the constituency. The high minded rhetoric that preceded it just makes the betrayal sting all the more.\n\nCivil rights leaders are denouncing the president and his party in the strongest language, and editorials on the failure of the R-D's to address civil rights are flying. Pundits of all stripes are predicting the black vote moving towards the NPP. Progressives in that party are taking full advantage of the beating the Republicans are taking, proposing more aggressive national policies to combat discrimination in housing, employment, and education."
 LBJ.140.a:0 "There goes that bloc."

 LBJ.141.t:0 "Not a Hero"
 LBJ.141.desc:0 "President Johnson's weak Housing Act is making many Republican African Americans question their allegiances. It's hard to see more than squandered opportunity in the bill that was passed. It's becoming clear to many that Republicans won't sacrifice moderate white votes by strongly pursuing civil rights. President Johnson's credibility as an ally, established by his support for voting rights, has taken a nosedive.\n\nThese developments will hurt the RDs in the South, where black support for their candidates was crucial in holding back NPP-R challengers. It will take stronger efforts on behalf of their rights to repair the relationship with black voters.
 LBJ.141.a:0 "We'll weather this, somehow."

 USA.1702.d:0 ""Friends, today is a momentous day in American history. Two centuries ago our nation's birth was a milestone in the long quest for freedom, but the beautiful, bold dream that our forefathers fought for has yet to reach its consummation. Today, rather than set forth a new dream, I wish to urge the old dream on. The dream that I, too, have cried out for all my political career. I cry for more than simple freedom to act, to speak, and to be happy; I cry for freedom from the conflict that we embroil ourselves in, time and time again. For the majority of our great country's history, we have been in conflict with nations both foreign and civil. Well, I say that no longer shall we fight. No longer shall we enslave ourselves to the sword. Going forward, our swords shall be hammered back into plowshares."\n\n"America, I ask you to look deep inside your hearts and truly realize the spiritual and emotional revolution this country is about to embark upon. No more saber-rattling with foreign powers, no more annual threats of annihilation. No America, I say unto you, that part of history is finished. Now comes the time for peace and reconciliation with those whom we have wronged, and those who have wronged us."\n\n"I have been given a great responsibility to shepherd our great nation into such an era, and it is not one that I accept lightly, nor is it a burden I can carry alone. It is my belief that this administration should incorporate the wisest and most peaceable of individuals, as well as those most modest, such that understanding between all may be achieved. I promise this, America, and more.""

USA_68_Glenn_Presidency_desc:0 "Under the bold new leadership of John Glenn, the R-Ds have recovered from their shocking defeat in 1964 and will lead America into a new age- an age of prosperity, equality, and above all, progress! While the celebrations are ending, we will need to appoint a cabinet and prepare ourselves for the long road ahead- to succeed in our objectives, we must advocate to the American people on behalf of the space program, and manage our resources carefully to ensure extraterrestrial superiority.\n\nOur laboratories and engineers are standing by, prepared to return America to its status as the most technologically advanced of the three superpowers. The Manned Spacecraft Center has already been given orders to resume operations, and soon Americans will return to space. Per aspera ad astra!"
USA_Glenn_Time_to_Clean_House_desc:0 "The NPP has been expelled from the executive branch by the will of the people, but their influence still remains. Their appointees are still dotting the administration like rats in the walls- and while their intentions may be good, their effect on our administration is not. Many of them are young activists who should never have been hired or old legacy employees who should have retired long ago.\n\nFirst things first, we get rid of everyone who isn't interested in following our goals- they simply have no place in our new vision for the United States. The radicals will be thrown out, and we will restore stability and rationality to our government once more. And then, we can begin enacting the president's plans..."
USA_Glenn_Appease_the_Party_desc:0 "Supporting the space program is all very well and good, but we have to be realistic about this process. Many of our supporters are skeptical of our plans for NASA, and no matter how many aerospace jobs we can put in their states, there's no getting around the fact that we're going to be spending a lot of money. With the C-NPP advocating expansive social programs, the FR-NPP demanding we increase the defense budget, and the Democrats in our own party suggesting that maybe we should just spend less, we'll have to fight tooth and nail to give the program the funding it needs. We should start things off on the right foot by giving our allies the people they want in the positions they want. It might not be ideal, but giving out a few favors will let us get a lot more in return in the future, and keep the Democrats quiet for now."
USA_Glenn_Bring_in_the_Technocrats_desc:0 "We're bringing in the best that we can. Scientists, engineers, mathematicians, and all sorts of experts. Who cares that they have no political connections? Cronyism and corruption is how we got Nixon and nearly broke the party. Congress may complain, but we can appease them easily enough, and this will ultimately lead to a stronger support staff in the future. It's more important that the officials we hire know how to do their jobs than it is that they know their local Congressman. We're already fighting for second in the moon race, and we cannot rise to meet the challenge on the backs of political appointees."
USA_Glenn_Crossing_The_New_Frontier_desc:0 "America is a nation founded by explorers and pioneers, and a nation that has lost its way amidst the troubled times. To defeat the evils of fascism, we must show the world that democracy is the way of the future- a stable bedrock upon which mankind will make its way to the stars.\n\nOur journey will not be an easy one, but such is the nature of exploration. Columbus was met with nothing but doubters until the Spanish gave him the resources he needed- and he was a novice sailor. We are assailed with many skeptics as well, but we have the brainpower and resources of the greatest country in the world at our disposal. President Glenn shall lead our nation, and our species, into a brave new world."
USA_Glenn_Dream_Never_Died_desc:0 "NASA these days is a sad shell of what it used to be during the glorious days where we won the race into orbit. Funding has all but dried up, and the majority of its facilities are already decrepit after years of neglect. The German victory broke America's will to continue the space race, but not NASA. The few employees left from the early days still believe in its founding vision, and are ready to do the hard work of bringing NASA back to its full capability.\n\nWe have not forgotten how the Nazis sullied the lunar landscape with the swastika in 1962, and we will not forget our unfinished business on the moon. It's time to catch up in the race for the stars."
USA_Glenn_Pathway_to_the_Sky_desc:0 "The greatest hurdle to reaching space is not gaining altitude, it is attaining the speed necessary to maintain those altitudes, and reaching higher orbits- such as that of the moon- require even higher speeds, or increased quantities of propellant. Whichever approach we decide on, we will need to continue our development of rockets technology to get back on parity with the other superpowers. The capsule is critical to keep the astronauts alive, the avionics are necessary to direct the rocket, but the propulsion system is the most important part of the rocket to get it anywhere. We require an incredible amount of power to reach orbit, and to go further we must continue to refine our approach."
USA_Glenn_Stick_What_Worked_desc:0 "To further our endeavours in space, we must take every step to ensure the safety of our brave astronauts. Our Explorer program allowed us to make major advances in the field of unmanned exploration. Operating unmanned probes in orbit gives us insight into remote operations and controlling vehicles outside of the atmosphere, and allows us to test new and unproven launch systems without risking the lives of NASA personnel. It's time to bring back the Explorer program and take our first step into the great unknown."
USA_Glenn_Smaller_Payloads_desc:0 "In the cold vacuum of space, there is no room for error. The calculations to operate spacecraft need to be computed rapidly and accurately. Even the slightest mistake could mean the loss of an expensive rocket, or worse, the death of a mission crew.\n\nFortunately, our best mathematicians are developing innovative new computers to control our unmanned probes, which will both improve our capacity to gather scientific data, and the safety of our manned missions. Every possible error must be stamped out and eliminated to make our program as safe as it can be."
USA_Glenn_The_Boosters_desc:0 "As our rocketry program continues to develop, we must consider one of the most important questions to further our development. Which type of propulsion do we focus our efforts on? The tried and true solid fuel? Or the new and exciting possibilities opened up by liquid fuel?"
USA_Glenn_In_With_New_desc:0 "Our computers are capable of calculations at speeds that would have been impossible a few decades ago, but they suffer from one fundamental flaw; they are only as good as the people operating them. The same goes for our spacecraft, intricate machines that require an advanced understanding of their operations. Every member of NASA must be intimately familiar with their role in the team, and prepared to do their job, from Director Webb to the astronauts manning our spacecraft to the support staff at ground control. Machines serve our purposes well, but they will only reach other worlds under the guidance of men."
USA_Bigger_Is_Better_desc:0 "No American has been in space since 1962, when the space program had its funding slashed over the protests of our current president. Our unmanned program has made great strides towards our ultimate goals, but to prove ourselves to the American people and humanity, we must return to orbit.\n\nProject Daedalus will put a man in orbit for the first time since Eberhard Köllner's moon landing in January 1962, further our study of space travel and its effects on the human body, and show the world that the United States of America has returned to the race across the final frontier."
USA_Glenn_Solid_Fuel_desc:0 "Spaceflight is complicated; the more points of potential failure we introduce, the more likely it is that failure will occur. Solid fuel rockets offer the advantage of being dependable and, well, solid. Primitive solid fuel rockets have been used since medieval times for the purposes of warfare, but under President Glenn we will turn them into an instrument of exploration. These time-tested rockets offer a high level of reliability and simplicity- and when you're sitting on top of a giant fuel container, travelling at hundreds of miles per hour, you want all the reliability you can get."
USA_Glenn_Liquid_Fuel_desc:0 "Liquid fuel rockets are an all-American invention- they may have been co-opted by the Nazis for the V2 program, but they were invented by an American, Dr. Robert Goddard, two decades before anyone cared about the name von Braun!\n\nPatriotic sentiments aside, the Germans used them with good reason- liquid fuel is far more efficient than solid due to the compressibility of liquids and a significantly lighter rocket. We will beat the fascists at their own game and rise to the stars on a stream of burning liquid propellant!"
USA_Dust_Off_Plans_desc:0 "The reluctance of politicians to invest in the future of humanity is appalling. Rather than spend money for potential gains in the future, most would rather take the safe bet and remain at a standstill. Our president knows the value of scientific progress, however, and is willing to make bold and daring strides into the unknown- and back it up with a budget to match.\n\nOur old facilities still have old plans and proposals for various projects- including our own moon landing and other ambitious projects. Let's turn our engineers loose and see what they can come up with."
USA_Saturn_V_desc:0 "Our best scientists and engineers have come back with an old plan, to which they've made significant modifications. This mighty rocket is the largest one we have ever constructed, and carries a hefty price tag to match. The Saturn I-IV rockets were originally designed just before the end of the US space program in an effort to prepare for our own moonshot, and now our new design will carry Americans to the moon and beyond. There are still further modifications to be made before putting it into production, but the work of the old NASA has made our journey much easier."
USA_New_NASA_desc:0 "NASA has been left adrift and rudderless for years, thanks to the shortsighted views of previous administrations since we "lost" the space race, cutting funding and pushing manpower to other areas. But that was just the first battle, not the whole war. There is so much to discover among the stars, so much to explore, that we shouldn't be confining ourselves to being simply second best. With massive new funding, we can rebuild the space program, and push past all the boundaries! It's time to go where no man has gone before!"
USA_Siphon_Funding_desc:0 "The Pentagon budget is massive: it's the single largest line item in federal expenditures. Now, while most of it goes to things like paying our soldiers and maintaining our tanks, ships and planes, there is always a bit here and there that isn't actually going to keep America safe right now. Pet projects, bloated defense contracts, and theoretical programs that are years, if not decades away from fruition. If we divert some funding from these programs to NASA, we can get to space much faster. And if a few guys in uniforms with too many stars on their shoulders and not enough imagination in their brains start yelling, well so be it."
USA_Best_Brightest_desc:0 "There was a time when applications to join NASA outnumbered the available jobs by a factor of five to one, and the best and brightest of America would excitedly jump to joining the space program. Now, it's hard to fill all the positions, as there is more money and prestige in the private sector for boring jobs like financial analysts and designing cars. If we are getting back into the Space Race, then we need to get them back. Better wages is just part of the plan: we need to make it so that people willingly come, to bring new ideas, new perspectives. They need to know that they are going to make our world a better place by exploring the cosmos. "
USA_Upgrade_Testing_Range_desc:0 "The Jet Propulsion Laboratory is the crown jewel of the American space program. However, with budget cuts and manpower shortages in the past few years, the facility has fallen into a state of disorganization and demoralization. But that's nothing that a few million dollars, some brand new room sized computers and a coat of paint can't fix. Soon the contagious dreams of youngsters wanting to build the spaceships of the future to explore the solar system, to see if the truth is out there..."
USA_Money_Never_Stops_desc:0 "The National Aeronautics and Space Administration is now back on its feet, and proposing some big plans: probes to explore all the other planets in the solar system, rovers for Mars, a gleaming new space station in orbit around the planet, reusable space shuttles, and even a base on the moon, all powered by bigger and more powerful rockets. It will be expensive, in the tens of billions of dollars. But that is a small price to pay to further our knowledge of space, the universe, and our place in it, and to beat the Germans in every possible manner. They may have landed on the Moon first, but America will go to infinity and beyond!"
USA_Surviving_The_Cosmos_desc:0 "	Many times has the United States of America ventured beyond the grasp of her planet's soil, and many times has it been successful. However, our most recent plans to travel, not just beyond our world, but to grace others, are far more daunting and difficult challenges than the American space program has ever faced. Having never launched Astronauts beyond low Earth orbit, we are ill-prepared for the dangers and difficulties in keeping them alive in space for more than a few days. Before we can begin the true work of getting to both the Moon and Mars, we must first surmount the challenge of ensuring that our brave solar sailors are alive when they actually reach their heavenly destinations."
USA_Board_Diagnostics_desc:0 "	To be chosen as an astronaut candidate is to be one of an extremely select number of individuals, and to actually become an astronaut is an even rarer honor. In short, it requires an extraordinary amount of talent, followed by an equally extraordinary amount of training. As time has gone on, astronaut selection has gone down, and the training has become inadequate for the realities of modern spaceflight. To rectify this issue, we must implement new training regimens for astronaut candidates to ensure they are up to speed with current realities of NASA. In addition, we will begin pulling some of the most exemplary pilots that the United States military has to offer as candidates for the next class of NASA astronauts."
USA_Rework_Capsule_desc:0 "	This new era of American space travel faces hazards and challenges never before anticipated or planned for by our engineers. Most of our current crew capsules were designed in the late fifties or early sixties and, as such, are woefully under equipped to handle the dangers in traveling beyond low Earth orbit. For example, most of our crew modules lack a docking port, meaning that, should it be used in the Apollo Program, our astronauts traveling to the Moon would have to land with all of their fuel in tow, forcing them to expend much more rocket propellant when returning back to Earth. In addition, none of our current capsules have a carrying capacity for more than 2 individuals, with almost no cargo space: an unacceptable shortcoming for a Lunar lander.\n\nTo rectify these problems, a new, more modern crew capsule must be designed. This capsule would be far more spacious than previous iterations, with a capacity for 3 or possibly 4 astronauts. In addition, it would contain small, but serviceable living quarters, as missions to the Moon and other places beyond low Earth orbit will take days to weeks. Overall, while designing and constructing this new capsule may prove expensive, it may be the most vitally important part of getting to the Moon."
USA_Pinpoint_Thrusters_desc:0 "The current plan for the Apollo Moon landing is to have the main crew module remain in lunar orbit with a single crewman remaining aboard, while a specialized lander with the other two crewmen travels down to the surface. After concluding surface activities, the lander will return to orbit to dock with the crew module. If NASA is to go through with this idea, both our lander and crew module will require more advanced reaction control systems (RCS), or pinpoint thrusters, colloquially. \n\nPreviously, the pinpoint thrusters of American spacecraft could basically only control rotational motion and minor attitude adjustment. Should our current plan for the Apollo Program come to fruition, the ability to dock two spacecraft- something rarely performed by NASA in the past- will become a necessity. As such, the newly designed Apollo crew capsule and lander will require more advanced and precise reaction control systems that can control not only perform course adjustment and rotation, but close maneuvering and minor thrust."
USA_Rework_Suit_desc:0 "	The current American space suit designs are meant for short excursions in the zero-g environs of low Earth Orbit and, as such, are simply not equipped to handle long trips in space, and especially not walking on the moon. If we not only want to send a man to the moon, but allow him to land there, two new space suit designs must be commissioned. Firstly, we simply need a more modern, streamlined, general-purpose space suit: something that our astronauts will wear while in space. It will need to be relatively light, flexible, and unobtrusive, able to survive in low pressures and moderate conditions.\n\nThe other variety of suit is a more difficult engineering challenge. It will be our extravehicular suit, expected to perform everything from short spacewalks for basic repairs, to extreme lunar excursions lasting several hours. It must not be too heavy, nor too bulky, as our astronauts must perform basic tasks, like walking, and sensitive tasks, like manipulating specialized tools. This extravehicular suit will be one of the cornerstones upon which the future of American space exploration is built; without it, we are going nowhere."
USA_Improve_Insulation_desc:0 "The boundless vacuum of space is a place of extremes, seldom more true than in temperature. Without an atmosphere, there is no protective shield against temperature changes, so the temperatures a spacecraft experiences can range from a scalding 200 degrees Fahrenheit in the sunlight to 300 degrees below zero in the shade. While in previous years our astronauts would simply wear heavy pressure suits while in space, our future forays into the heavens will require a new solution. Astronauts simply cannot be expected to wear such bulky equipment for days or weeks on end. To counteract this problem, our crew modules will have to be equipped with the best insulation available, such that they may survive both the icy and scalding regions of the void."
USA_Glenn_The_Great_Unknown_desc:0 "	Who knows what lies beyond the miniscule coil of Earth's influence? Who knows what dangers lie in above the sky, in the great boundless void that surrounds all? Who knows what dangers we may encounter when we enter that void? If the American space program is to be prepared for a landing on the Moon and, eventually, Mars, we must harden our system against damage. We must prepare for every eventuality, from communications failures to solar flares to radiation to cabin fires. All of these potential problems, and more, must be planned for. There must be a backup for every possible system, and a protocol for every possible disaster."
USA_Glenn_Improved_Fuel_Lines_desc:0 "	A fuel tank is a rather simple thing; perhaps the most simple component of any space-bound vessel. Obviously, without fuel, a rocket will not fly, and to reach the Moon and Mars, our rockets will need an extraordinary amount of it. As such, it becomes necessary to take a step back and reexamine our fuel tank design, tweaking certain elements to create the most optimal design possible. Certain features, such as advanced alloys for more robust construction, as well as more sheathing and insulation for electrical components, will allow our rockets to be much safer. Most important however, is weight, for when the cost of launching a pound of payload into orbit may be in excess of a thousand dollars, it must be considered. To ensure that we can launch more, for less, investigating lighter materials from which to construct our fuel tanks may prove worthwhile."
USA_Glenn_Upgraded_Radio_desc:0 "	No great achievement of humanity was done in silence. All of Mankind's creations, from the Great Pyramids of Giza; to the Great Wall of China; to the torch of the New Colossus that beckons the huddled masses into liberty, are a consequence of our unique ability of communication. A lunar landing is easily on-par with such spectacular monuments of our species, and thus is no different in terms of needing communication, most especially regarding contact while the mission is in progress. To ensure that we remain connected with our astronauts during our next forays into the stars, we will upgrade the majority of our Earthbound transmitters, as well as develop new comm systems for our crew capsules. Without the help of ground control, they will get nowhere; after all, from highest heaven to deepest nether, they travel farthest who travel together."
USA_upgrading_the_infrastructure_desc:0 "We have accomplished more for spaceflight than most nations ever will, but we can not lose our momentum now. It's time to fly even higher, and to do that we need to improve the infrastructure that supports NASA. Larger runways will support specialized aircraft that can safely transport critical rocket parts, and improved research facilities allow us to test larger rocket engines, fabricate parts with even more precision, and overcome the engineering challenges that have shackled us to Earth for so long."
USA_Human_Stress_test_desc:0 "Being in space is, understandably, harsh upon the human body, with the effects of zero g-force and high amounts of radiation- not to mention the horrific sense of isolation- wearing down on astronauts. Getting there can be even more stressful, as the extremely high g-forces during launch and reentry have the potential to scrap entire missions by knocking astronauts unconscious. In order to counteract these potential effects, we can harden our cadets by including high g-force centrifuge training, isolation chambers, and simulation zero-g exercises into their training regimen."
USA_Ready_For_Anything_desc:0 "Thanks to our initiative, the United States of America and her space program are as prepared as can be for the dangers of venturing far out into the great void. With the finalization of these great advancements in technology, spacecraft design, and procedure, it seems as though no astral disaster can prove too challenging, or any distance too great, to overcome. America, her astronauts, and her space program are aware of the great difficulties that lie ahead, but now they need not fear. Houston may be assured: there will be no problems."
USA_Stars_Beckon_desc:0 "We have persisted through budget cuts, doubting Congressmen, and the humiliation of the Nazi moon landing to retake our spot as the leading nation in the exploration of space. NASA's efforts have met with success after success, and we must ride this wave of momentum even farther afield while enthusiasm is still high. The administration is abuzz with an energy not seen in years, and a sense that we are on our way to greatness, as we reach out to touch the stars."
USA_Lessons_of_Gemini_desc:0 "The Gemini program was one of our greatest successes, giving us our first practical experience with manned spaceflight and the first taste of the stars for President Glenn. While this opportunity may have been squandered, the lessons of the program must not be forgotten if we wish to continue onwards and upward. On the back of the Gemini program, we have achieved greatness, and now we shall surpass those heights."
USA_Heartbreak_Apollo_desc:0 "The worst day of John Glenn's life was the day of the Germans landed on the moon. The pain and anguish that brought, the long days of sorrow and depression, gave him a resolve never to fall behind again in the race for glory among the stars. We cannot allow ourselves to be held back by past failures- instead we must learn the lessons of those failures and allow them to propel us forward."
USA_Project_Viking_desc:0 "Unmanned probes are not flashy, cannot think for themselves, and cannot be the face of the space program. However, they offer several other advantages, the main one being that we can test out our systems without having to unnecessarily risk the lives of our astronauts. We are planning the most ambitious exploration project in the history, and it would be foolish to embark on this great journey without making at least a few trial runs. Directing more funding to our probe division will allow us to develop the sort of data we need for the safest possible landing we can get."
USA_Project_Pathfinder_desc:0 "Unmanned probes are not flashy, cannot think for themselves, and cannot be the face of the space program. However, they offer several other advantages, the main one being that we can test out our systems without having to unnecessarily risk the lives of our astronauts. We are planning the most ambitious exploration project in the history, and it would be foolish to embark on this great journey without making at least a few trial runs. Directing more funding to our probe division will allow us to develop the sort of data we need for the safest possible landing we can get."
USA_Project_Mariner_desc:0 "When our courageous explorers set off on the journey of a lifetime, they shall not go alone. The American people have been disaffected and demoralized for too long. President Glenn will address the nation, and make them know that their country needs them. Our heroes of science and progress will inspire the nation, and our population's spirits shall soar with our rockets to greater heights than ever before."
USA_Project_Ares_desc:0 "The time has come. The crowning achievement of the American space program and the pinnacle of human technological development, Project Ares, is ready for launch. Our crew travels with the prayers of every American, and the eyes of the entire world upon them. We have proven we could equal the heights of the German space program; now the American eagle must soar to far greater heights.\n\nOur technicians, engineers, and launch personnel have been preparing for this mission for their entire careers. The red planet lies within our grasp, and we cannot let it slip through our fingers. The flag of our nation standing tall on Mars, millions of miles from our home, shall reaffirm our status as the greatest country in the world!\n\nGodspeed, gentlemen. Start the countdown."
USA_Eagle_has_Landed_desc:0 "We have dared to attempt the impossible, and now, thanks to the tireless work by NASA and the Glenn administration, we have done it. For the first time in human history, a man has stepped upon the surface of another world, and returned safely to our soil. The nation has effectively shut down, with riotous celebrations held across the country and a ticker-tape parade held for the crew of Ares Four in New York City. Calls of congratulations have come from leaders across the world, including everyone from our allies in the OFN to the Prime Minister of Japan. The flight crew have described themselves as the happiest men on the planet, but the White House staff knows better. The happiest man in the world sits in the Oval Office, half-listening to the terse congratulations of the Fuhrer, basking in America's greatest triumph of the century."
USA_Glenn_Power_of_the_Atom_desc:0 "To solely focus on atomic power through the lens of the bombing of Pearl Harbor is to miss the forest for the trees. Nuclear energy, if harnessed correctly, could provide nearly limitless energy for millions of Americans still suffering from blackouts or interrupted deliveries of coal and oil. It is high time we redoubled our scientific efforts to harness the power of the atom, for both its peaceful and warlike applications, to succor our people and instill fear in our enemies."
USA_Glenn_We_shall_have_it_all_desc:0 "Nuclear technology is, by and large, dependent on a single natural resource: uranium. The means for securing domination over our rivals in nuclear technology must start from seizing any and all natural deposits of this mineral, or buying out all of our rivals. And what we cannot have, we must ensure that our enemies cannot make use of either."
USA_Glenn_Corner_The_Market_desc:0 "Forcing the rival superpowers out of the nuclear business can't simply be done by restricting access to uranium alone. The myriad machines and intermediate inputs necessary to build both nuclear reactors and nuclear weapons are often commercially available, criss-crossing the world through the arteries of global trade on a daily basis. Cornering the market for these components will not only weaken our enemies, but serve to empower ourselves, if we can afford it."
USA_Glenn_Yeld_Must_Grow_desc:0 "Denial of the enemy is not enough to win the war. Our own advancement of the nuclear sciences must match, and overpace, that of Germany and Japan if we mean to conclusively overpower them in nuclear armaments. The development of ever-stronger nuclear weapons demands ever-larger investments in our scientific and industrial base - a price well worth paying."
USA_Glenn_New_Delivery_System_desc:0 "Having the industry to develop and produce nuclear weapons is only the start; we must continually invest in and refine our delivery systems. Accuracy, yield, and survivability are words to live by if we plan to win a nuclear war; thankfully, the Pentagon has proposed a new generation of missiles, the Eros system, that should deliver on all of these criteria."
USA_Glenn_Increase_Payload_desc:0 "The effectiveness of our nuclear arsenal depends on the retention of multiple means of delivering a salvo of atomic fire on our enemies - by land, by sea, and by air. Continued development of the three legs of the nuclear triad will be essential in convincing our enemies that they have no hope of winning a nuclear conflict of the United States, and that their best interests lie at the negotiating table on our terms."
USA_Glenn_Upgrade_the_Targeting_desc:0 "Circular error probable - the bane of any ballistics targeting exercise. While some would argue that accuracy is overrated when a weapon's explosive force is measured in megatons of TNT, accuracy will forever and always be a crucial indicator of a weapon system's maturity. The more missiles we can accurately deliver on target, the more confident we can end a conflict with a single stroke. The supercomputers of NASA, already used to calculate rocket trajectories, can easily be repurposed for the work of nuclear warfare."
USA_Glenn_Federal_Pilot_Reactors_desc:0 "Even if politicians and scientists are convinced of the benefits of nuclear power, America as a whole remains wary of the atomic project, with the bombing of Pearl Harbor seared into the public conscience. The process of winning the people over to the side of progress will take time and patience, as we demonstrate the safety and benefits of nuclear energy via a program of federally funded 'pilot reactors' in several cities across America."
USA_Glenn_Pay_for_Conversation_desc:0 "The benefits of nuclear power are immense, but so are the start-up costs. Not every state or local municipality in America will be able to shoulder the cost of ensuring a safe and stable power supply for all of its residents. Thankfully, the federal government can step in to fill the gap, both to ensure a steady demand for expertise in the nuclear field, and to win a few votes along the way... "
USA_Glenn_Recruit_Disney_desc:0 "As much as we've tried to boil down the science of nuclear power for the average citizen, there are bottlenecks. Most Americans don't read Scientific American, and many viewers yawn and change the channel when faced by an egghead on television. Selling a government project to the people has always been as much about familiar images and relatability as it has been about the actual facts at hand. And who - or what - is more familiar and relatable to the average American than Mickey Mouse?"
USA_Glenn_We_Control_The_Power_desc:0 "There are those who say that the value of a nuclear arsenal, of a nation's deterrent, starts and ends with its mere existence, by simply retaining the ability to vaporize the world a hundred times over with the press of a button. President Glenn disagrees; the atom is not like a god, terrible and vengeful. It is a tool - and a tool has many uses, if we only would employ it as such in our negotiations with Germany and Japan."
USA_Early_Warning_Station_Reykjavic_desc:0 "To boldly make nuclear force a centerpiece of American strategy requires that we protect ourselves against any German or Japanese attempt to disarm or disrupt our nuclear arsenal. Early warning and (where possible) surgical strikes must be the centerpiece of any such effort, and Iceland, the closest OFN territory to continental Europe, is ideally located to host the facilities needed to achieve this objective. We will draw up plans to base new over-the-horizon radars and hardened air bases in Iceland, the tip of the spear against the Unity Pakt and the German menace."
USA_Nuclear_Iceland_desc:0 "The Hawaiian Missile Crisis proved one thing, above all else: the immediate presence of a nuclear threat has the potential to bring any power to the negotiating table.  If a nation perceives that there is a new threat in their backyard, they will seek to address it, preferably without triggering doomsday.  And, fortunately, the United States has just the place for such a threat to be established: Iceland.  \n\nAcross the archipelago of bases that make up US Forces Iceland, we already have a large number of nuclear-capable B-58s and B-52s ready to go at a moment's notice, of course.  But by constructing new missile silos for our MRBMS and ICBMs, a signal would be sent.  Planes and crews may come and go, but silos are permanent.  It would remind Germania that we have the capacity to strike fast, and strike hard.  Such a gambit would surely bring them to the table and halt their madness.  \n\nAnd if they try anything, well, we'll be closer to them than ever before."
USA_Land_Down_Under_desc:0 "Australia, liberty's last ocean in the Western Pacific, has lived under the constant threat of Japanese invasion for over twenty years. It's time that the extension of the OFN nuclear umbrella be made that much more tangible for our Aussie allies, to provide them with the air bases and tactical missiles that will tip the scales in their favor against the numerically-superior Japanese adversary."
USA_Nuclear_Sub_Dev_desc:0 "The Pacific Ocean is vast and almost impossibly deep in areas - perfect cover for a new fleet of ballistic missile submarines, waiting for the signal to deliver atomic retribution against the Japanese enemy. But the Japanese, with a presence from Hawaii to the former East Indies, will doubtless be vigilant against any intrusion by our silent service. The underseas arms race is on; our submarines must be engineered for victory..."
USA_Speaking_Softly_desc:0 "The Germans and Japanese must be made to understand that America does not hide behind the moat of the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. American submarines hide in the vast oceans, bringing nuclear annihilation to the very doorstep of our enemies; and should the Japanese or Germans sweep the seas clean, they will find American bombers and missiles waiting to strike beyond the range of their precious navies. If they want to reverse the tables and strike first, we will know, and beat them to the punch. \n\nAmerica can, and will, win a nuclear war. The sooner Japan and Germany realize that, they will realize the folly of continuing the arms race, and come to the table to seek a new accommodation."
USA_The_Sanctity_Of_The_OFN_desc:0 "Even in negotiations between the superpowers, America is made stronger by the presence and support of its allies in the OFN. They are partners - not the feudal liege lords of German or the colonial kleptocracies of the Japanese - and even if they do not have a seat at the table, they deserve to be consulted and kept informed of where we seek to lead the OFN, to the ultimate goal of our nuclear diplomacy - if not peace in our time, then at least peace through strength."
USA_Readying_The_Big_Stick_desc:0 "Just in case the Germans and the Japanese thought all of our previous military posturing and development was just a dog-and-pony show, we'll make sure that we have a demonstration of the latest and greatest American military inventions and hardware, for all the world to see. It would be a terrible waste for this to actually ever be used, of course, and we're counting on the Germans and Japanese seeing it the same way we do."
USA_Seven_Second_Detection_desc:0 "Contingency planning and redundancies must be built into every strategy. What if the enemy overpowers our forward warning stations in Australia and Iceland by surprise? America cannot be left defenseless due to its reliance on forewarning from distant shores. We will install a final set of early warning radars in Canada and Alaska; if we ever end up dependent on these systems, the window to retaliate will be miniscule, but it will be there."
USA_A_Fragile_Peace_desc:0 "America now maintains the means to destroy its enemies a thousand times over, to take every nuclear weapon in their arsenal and match it - and then some. The quantitative and qualitative superiority of our atomic arsenal is manifestly clear, and our enemies challenge it at their own peril. \n\nWith our nuclear superiority as an article of faith amongst the American public, surely we can afford to be magnanimous. Through the Strategic Arms Limitation Talks, we hope to convince the superpowers to take a step back from the precipice of oblivion. We do not seek the adulation of Germany and Japan: only that their representatives come to the table as reasonable men, to promise the world that the sun will rise tomorrow."
USA_Glenn_Closing_Empathy_Deficit_desc:0 "Although our administration's aims lie towards the heavens, it is within our responsibility to remember our duties at the ground level. With that, the other half of our focus ought to be on the state of the United States' social welfare. Consistently, our government has overlooked the needs of our nation's neediest, and most downtrodden souls. Thus, we must act quickly to lift the spirits residing in the workers and veterans of America who have been so greatly beaten down, in order to secure not only a more stable nation, but a caring one as well. Besides, if we manage to please American citizens enough with our work towards economic security, they will be more than approving of our desires to fund NASA, right? \n\nTo start, our administration will work to reform pension programs for the retired elderly population of the United States. Regularly, their hard work has not paid off in their retirement, leaving them mistreated in care, but our administration will work to change that."
USA_Glenn_THe_Neediest_desc:0 "In drafting the bill for pension reform for the country, the administration has discussed the possible expansion of the developing legislation. In particular, we have realized that a large group of good, yet pained people that have gone overlooked by the government and the people of the United States: the disabled citizens of America. Consistently, disabled Americans overcome the difficulties of their conditions, yet receive no care for the lengths they go through to provide for themselves and their families. Our administration seeks to reverse this injustice, and will reach out to the disabled to bring them a brighter day by offering greater pensions toward them and their families. Furthermore, increased benefits will provide care for the military veterans who, through fighting for their nation, were forced to come home with debilitating injuries, particularly from the Second World War, and will seek to provide for their families as well. Besides, it's what Annie would want, right?"
USA_Glenn_THe_Downtrodden_desc:0 "With the work our cabinet has put into developing the inclusions we need in this bill to bridge every gap in American empathy, the most unfortunate persons of our society have been noted in being consistently looked past by Presidents of history as well. Here, we see the poor and destitute, those with little to no economic stability in their lives to begin with, and suffer throughout their lives with the difficulties they were born in, rather than created for themselves. With respect and care for such individuals, the proposed bill will include a section regarding the expansion of financial security nets and payments towards the Americans who find themselves living in a state of poverty. With this, we shall engage in a great fight against the issue of increasing poverty for the lives of American citizens across the country, and provide for them a method of escaping the circumstances they have been dealt with. "
USA_Glenn_Pension_Security_Bill_desc:0 "With the revisions towards the legislation finalized, our administration will send the bill towards vote in the Congress. Although many in our nation believe such a bill to be an "insult towards the Treasury," we will do all we can to make sure that the bill is secured for the less fortunate in our society. We, as Americans, are promised to live within a nation that champions freedom, justice, prosperity, and progress, and the bill we have composed will only expand upon the possibilities of living in a greater and empathetic society. The elderly, the disabled, and the less fortunate are Americans all the same, and thus deserve the right to a fairer society for them, and thus will enjoy a substantial increase in their provisions for all that they have equally suffered. Though many in the House and Senate believe the bill to be far too expensive, and a "political distraction from the President's extreme fascination with space," we must do what we can for our nation."
USA_Glenn_Beat_Big_Pharma_desc:0 "With the rapid advances of technology regarding health, the average American citizen's illnesses have been well studied and can easily be taken care of. However, they must bear with the suffering of paying the outrageous prices of the towering pharmaceutical companies, choking the average citizen who may be already suffering from a wide range of health issues. Such companies have taken a mix of shadowy economic strategies and hurting average Americans, and it is absolutely unacceptable to allow such practices to continue. Our administration will bring "Big Pharma" back in the line of acceptance. We will issue several restrictions on these companies' activities, and stand resolute in our fight against their monopoly of the health industry, as an industry that seeks to serve the sick and dying ought to act morally sound and economically responsible."
USA_Glenn_Secure_Workplace_desc:0 "The American worker, one of the cornerpieces in American economic stability, has been in a crisis for a great amount of time. Throughout contemporary history, workers have experienced great inequality in their respective workplaces, and while Unions aimed to fix this, their lack of membership due to American Right to Work Laws have restarted the imbalances within the workplace. To combat this, we must draft a bill which would tear down the Right to Work laws which have created such imbalances in the workplace. In doing so, workplaces may require the workers within to be a part of the associated union, stopping the imbalance of workers who receive the benefits of union membership without actually committing the sacrifice of official membership. With this, American workplaces will become a far more fair and just area of American life, building confidence for the fearful American workers to instead live, and work, towards greater unity and prosperity."
USA_Glenn_Unkept_Promisse_desc:0 "After fighting constantly in regards to the reformation of several pension programs, we have already made strong leaps into progress for social welfare programs in American society. However, every program created thus far has been aimed towards a specific group, and it's time to look outward, into a Social Security program for every American citizen around the nation. The beginning of such a creation will act as a new means of providing for the average man and woman, and usher in a new wave of confidence and prosperity in a time of financial fears and instability. In safeguarding Americans from financial failure, and offering provisions in the case of economic recession, we will put many Americans' fears of progress to rest, and allow the American economy to expand as it never has before. Yes, while it may be at the cost of government funding, is it not the care and concern of the people that we are looking to expand upon in the first place, and offer them happiness in such dire times?"
USA_Glenn_Rally_the_Republicans_desc:0 "With the Social Security Program having begun the process of drafting, we have managed to build towards abiding the fears of American citizenry in regards to financial situations. We must stand resolute in our support and joy at the prospect of reaching out to the people of the United States with the ideas of the bill, and thus, must rally support for our work throughout the states to maintain its success. In particular, the Northern and Midwestern Republican branch of the Republican-Democrats has been in celebration over the creation of such Social Security measures, and we must capitalize on the situation to increase public approval of our administration, and show that the American people are confident in the controversial program. Doing so will allow the party to reorganize, consolidate, and expand, offering the administration a large amount of support, and being able to continue advances towards the United States' success."
USA_Glenn_Beat_Down_the_Dems_desc:0 "Our success in the progress of creating Social Security Act has allowed Americans to enjoy a newfound confidence in American economics and financial stability, allowing the continued growth of our nation through the work of the everyday citizen. However, while we are overjoyed at our successes so far with American confidence in the bill, many in the nation remain fearful over the costs imposed upon the federal government in the passing of such an Act. We cannot allow such notions of fear and anxiety to plague American society and cause the death of our program before it's even been signed into law. Thus, it is our imperative to beat the Democratic side of the Republican-Democrats back in line, as they have expressed their ardent disapproval throughout the South and other areas of the nation. Doing so will nip the fears of Americans in the bud, and allow our administration to move forward in aiding American citizens and generating progress for the future."
USA_Glenn_Friends_Center_desc:0 "While Americans across the nation have remained divided over a plethora of issues, it is not without question that the possibility of success through bipartisan efforts is there, even if hard to find. So, it is time to reach out: the Central branch of the NPP has remained steadfast in their desire to aid American citizens and empower the American worker, and with our steps toward a Social Security Act, we must reach out to our friends within the Center-National Progressive Party.  Doing so not only allows us to garner further support on the bill, but also serves to end the fears of many Americans as well, as seeing that the two parties which divide the United States' political system working together will bring massive support for our administration, even if opposition towards the bill still remains vocal, within our own party as well as the National Progressive Party. We must stand together if we are to see the empowerment of the American worker!"
USA_Glenn_Hammer_the_Language_desc:0 "While we have managed to organize the supporting base behind the creation of the Social Security Act, we need to get to work on the next most important part of its creation: the writing and contents of the bill itself. Obviously, the bill is proving to be one of the most extensive social programs organized in American history, but we need to be effective in its wording and focus so that we do not lose the program to inefficiency and bureaucracy. The paragraphs of the bill must be examined by the administration and experts alike to guarantee its success. Furthermore, the bill has already proved to be controversial since its conception, especially amongst the National Progressive Party's right-leaning branch, and so we must consider who this bill will be going up against and how to make it both successful and viable. Americans have long faced difficulties for their nation, we are long overdue for a program created to pay them back for everything they have done for their nation."
USA_Glenn_Stop_Southern_desc:0 "Many in the administration back the foundations of the Social Security Act; however, fears continue to spread throughout the public and governmental levels. Having said that, there is an obvious group to point to in nominating suspects for such fear-mongering: the Dixiecrats within the R-D's remain strong in their opposition towards the bill, and have dared to claim that its "lack of functionality will only be matched by its costs." With that, we must remind them that the Republican-Democratic Party must stand together, and in doing so, they must be willing just as much as the Republicans have been in complying to Democratic demands. Thus, we shall discipline the Southern Democrats that seek to bring down the success our party has had, even if extreme elements of the NPP will grow in their absence. The American people are crying for help, and this act will supply the Republican-Democrats with the approval they are needing nowadays, even if the Democrats have complaints about the issue."
USA_Glenn_Social_Security_Act_desc:0 "The Administration, the Cabinet, experts from a multitude of academic fields, people from a wide range of groups have met to discuss, debate, and finalize changes and amendments to the clauses of the Social Security bill. Americans are ought there suffering from their lack of financial confidence, and it will not get better without action. However, after months of work, the Glenn administration has found it to be the right time to introduce the bill to Congress to be voted into law. The various factions of the American government have already rallied to taking sides and made up their mind about the bill. With hope, the Congress of the United States ought to be more than willing to accept the act of care we have pieced together, and we must move fast before our support is lost. Once American citizens stand proud for our administration with such success, we may move forward with the more pertinent projects as well, and channel funding to Space Administration later."
USA_Glenn_Clean_Gov_Best_Gov_desc:0 "While successful in our progress towards social reform, the administration has a new worry to focus on which continues to bring down public opinion of the government: the damned corruption found all over the place! Ever since Nixon, the American public has been worried sick over the possibility of public disgraces such as the corruption found within Nixon's wrongdoing. Even worse, as Nixon's actions did not only affect the federal government as a whole, but specifically the Republican-Democratic Party's stability! Failure is not an option within the American government, and it's about time we make sure of it. It's time we dredge up and throw out any remaining factors of corruption within our government. It is within our best efforts to make sure that we have earned the trust and respect of the citizenry before we experience chaos on a national level. In earning their trust, we can show them that we mean the best for them, and are not just selfish politicians of the day."
USA_Glenn_Crack_Down_On_Corruption_desc:0 "Although our successes as an administration have been fruitful for the American people, the successes of the working man have revealed a blanket of corrupt ties towards current legislation. The continuous complaints to the general public about our administration revealed a key detail in their monopolous control over the market: the tax incentives present in current legislation allows these massive businesses to continuously grow bigger, eventually giving way to the establishment of unfair business practices. Considering our administration's aims at cutting out unfair business practices as well as the destruction of corrupt elements of the government, it is without a doubt a necessity to repeal such tax policies, as it is unquestionable that these huge marketplaces have already sunk their fortunes into the pockets of Representatives and Senators vouching for them. For the sake of American fairness and equality, we must deal with this burden on society."
USA_Glenn_Empower_Senate_Ethics_Commitee_desc:0 "The United States government, having acted in the people's goodwill for so long, has an unfortunate underbelly of corrupted history found within. Though our Executive Branch has been the focus of corruption, we must expand our focus towards the Legislative Branch as well. With such foul acts of criminality existing in the very lawmaking body of our nation, we must build new foundations to ensure that we can clean up any spots of corruption in the United States Congress. Having said that, it is our administration's prerogative to empower the Senate Ethics Commission, as such a political body can serve the country has both a watchdog and cleanup service for any dark spots of corruption found within our Representatives and Senators. No longer will the acts of bribery and intimidation l stain the legislative process of our constitutional Republic; instead, we shall remain acting as a strong, resolute, and morally sound government that acts purely for the sake of the American citizen."
USA_Glenn_Fight_Off_Big_Buisness_desc:0 "Although we have successfully moved forward with establishing future methods of dealing with corrupt actions of United States politicians in the future, it would be dishonest to claim that we do not suffer from such disgusting acts of injustice in our government body already. The American people have already grown sick and tired of corrupt actions of the government with the blemishes of the past, and it is our duty to reach out to such weary souls and bring them hope. So, we will launch a full-scale investigation into any hints of corruption that may spring up in our government, whether it's one lawmaker or one hundred, it is our duty to make sure every bit of it is stamped out. The gross faults of the leaders of the United States in the past have allowed countless citizens to suffer under the burden of corruption, allowing for such low-reaching souls to prosper while the honest man falls, and we cannot allow such injustices to happen in our prosperous democracy any longer."
USA_Glenn_Ban_Lobbying_desc:0 "Finally, our administration has managed to put the boot down upon the lobbying groups that took the reigns of our nation unfortunately so long ago. With enough work and effort put together by the Cabinet, we have managed to unshackle American leadership in being able to lead how they want, not how lobbyists want. Now, however, we have them on the defense, and we have waited long enough to finally begin pushing for our final move against their injustice: a complete ban on political lobbying within our nation. Injustices towards the American people are wrought within these groups, and far too much has corruption allowed to flourish in democracies in our world, and to imagine it within our nation is disgusting. We must make the final move, as banning lobbying groups will hopefully be strong enough to push our leaders far back from any corruptive acts which may sway their acts in office. Instead, we shall act as a more just society, without any restrictions from the scum of lobbying."
USA_Glenn_Just_Restrict_Lobbying_desc:0 "The practice of lobbying has gone unchecked by lawmakers whose pockets were filled with the money given by the very political bodies that expand the very practice itself. Thus, we cannot allow our administration to trust any such bodies that dole out American dollars to politicians stooping at their level. Rather, we must begin the process of forwarding legislation that tightens the grip on the activity of lobbying, with establishing limits on the size of such groups and clamping down on the flow of money from these groups to our esteemed leaders. It is without question that a large amount of Senators and Representatives have allowed themselves to accept the process and profit from it, and so many will find our efforts to be "far too idealistic" for their standards. However, we live in a free American democracy, and we cannot allow such groups to taint our nation's leaders into changing our laws for profit."
USA_Glenn_A_City_On_A_Hill_desc:0 "With a shining sun, a gentle breeze, a fairer economy,and a happy and healthy American populace, we have, rest assured, done what we can to make sure that the United States of America is better off then when we came in, as every American politician ought to wish to do. And now, with our help, leaders are no longer being clamped down by lobbyist's schemes, and with that, we have already seen happiness within Americans. The effort put into social reform ought to have done more than enough to win over hearts and minds, and with our efforts to help the broken, we have managed to create a more caring society as well. Around the world, democracy has been harmed by the stains of dictators and corruption, but we have done what we can to make sure that the United States can stand as an example for abroad. America is beautiful, and Americans are a worthwhile people to care for, and now that we have, it is time to move forward in history, and look more into the future: into the Heavens above."

Each name a different figure in the West Wing of the White House. Each name listed another individual with different aspirations and goals, with some against one another or even against ourselves. It had only been a few days since Glenn's swearing in as President and he was already feeling the exhaustion of the bureaucracy found within the federal government. \n\n"Lamont, Lane, Lang-" Gore continued.\n\n"Al, just a minute. You'll wear yourself out going through all that, let's take a minute to think about all of this. Look at all those names you've listed off already, and you're only on the twelfth letter of the alphabet. Doesn't that tell you something?" Glenn asked.\n\n"We're losing most of our budget on White House aids?" Gore said, giving Glenn a good laugh out of it.\n\n"Well, you're not entirely wrong, Gore. Think about it: our campaign was built on several foundations, but all of these names are adapted to the last President's set. If they continue on as they have been, they will never be able to adapt to the administration's goals. We've fought so hard to get where we are, and we can't just let all of this slow us down. The people are suffering out there, Al, they want progress, and Hunt and Judd and Lamont are not going to be the ones that get us out there."\n\nThe Vice President nodded his head slowly to the President's statement. "What will you have me do then, John?" Gore asked. \n\n"Well, firstly, that list there might give you a headache, might want to get rid of it. Instead, let's come up with another list. A list of people who have our dream, who have that want to get out there, and bring this country farther than it ever has before, Al. We fight for America, and we need to find those who will do the same with us."\n\nWith a smile and a handshake, Gore left the room to handle the President's request."

He promised to unite the country after years of division, to bring each citizen closer together, to help those who need it most, and to bring the country out farther than it has ever reached before. Having gone through enough time to prove himself in the Presidential seat, reports indicate that the administration is most definitely focusing on advancing; however, have they forgotten the rest of their campaign promises? \n\nAlthough there have been no official statements, many White House reports show a continuous focus towards the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, with recent actions in the West Wing allowing for nearly double the staff held in NASA before, as well as stark increases towards the program's funding. Furthermore, many analysts have noticed a steady increase in ties to such activities within the Congressional branch as well, as roughly half of senatorial meetings and hearings have been in regards to the aviation industry and the country's possible future in the exploration of Space. However, it has been noted that President Glenn's administration has not given any public attention towards recent events, as the only official willing to give a statement was Howard Metzenbaum, the President's Chief of Staff, who said that, "the President promised Americans the possibility of growth and prosperity in manners they have not seen before, and the administration is working diligently in an effort to ensure this happens." Reporters are on standby to investigate the situation and developments come in."

glenn.3.desc:0 "A thunderous storm had overtaken the night sky across the state of Maryland. Great flashes of lightning and the booming cannons of thunder coated continued to rage and took hold across the dark clouds above the White House, while showers overtook the streets and drowned out the vegetation of the nation's capital. There, President John Glenn slept soundly, warmed by the covers of the bed and his loving Anna in the dark room he called home throughout his Presidency. \n\n"Raumfahrer-Ein, Zwei, and Drei hitting the surface now." Köllner said, as the craft touched down upon the grey wasteland, with a great blue and green sphere floated thousands upon thousands of miles behind them. Honored by his leadership, Köllner was declared to be the first to take the first step. And thus, the proud German floated softly to the surface of the Moon. He turned to grab something out of the landing craft, and walked forward several places. "For Germania, to the stars and beyond." He said as he planted the flag adorned with a black Swastika to forever stare back at his home planet. There, millions of Germans celebrated across the Reich, taking part in a celebration to honor the glory, the wonder, the majesty of the Reich's power. Across the seas, however, Americans within the capital were devastated by the events of the past few hours. Men and women stood, crying into one another's shoulders. Project leads cursed and kicked, going so far as vandalizing their work stations in anger. Hours felt like days, and with every passing moment, the repercussions of their failure became apparent: projects were left in dark rooms' shelves, workers were leaving far earlier than they were scheduled to, and new reports of budget slashes came with every passing hour. Tears stained the once successful organization's pride. \n\n"J-J-John, are you alright?" Anna said as she shook her husband. The President rocketed back up within his bed, as cold streams of sweat journeyed down his forehead, burning his eyes. He looked as his wife's worried expression while he wiped away the sweat, thinking about everything that had transpired within his dreams. The President realized what had happened, and did the only logical action in his mind next: he gave a large embrace to his wife."

Nelson Rockefeller said to the concerned expression worn by President Glenn. "Regarding the Germans, sir, they would most likely have spread out their nuclear weapons across the multiple fronts they have to deal with; however, our main concern would most likely be within secret coverage within their French puppet or even near the Northern Sea in Wilhelmshaven to launch into the Atlantic and preparing a nuclear strike by sea." \n\nThe reports laid out by his Secretary of State did not smother the worries held by the President of the United States' rivals' nuclear capabilities. Years of tension did not play to the favor of peace and "common manhood" within the enemies' eyes, as far as the President was concerned. However, if the years of experience piloting aircraft taught John Glenn anything, it was not to panic in the middle of a crisis, unless you seek to crash and burn. Another lesson taught to John Glenn during his time as a pilot was a simple rule, but an effective one: the man with the bigger gun is going to win the fight. With the air capabilities already being improved with the funding for NASA, there remains but one obstacle ahead for the nuclear arms race: nuclear power itself. Glenn picked up his office phone and spoke into it, "Hello, ma'am, could you patch me through to Javits?" \n\n"Absolutely, sir, the Defense budget more than allows the research program to go through, and we could absolutely coordinate with them to work towards a greater missile supply. And about the nuclear power, the report we just received measures the approval rating to be 'considerable,' meaning that you seem to have the go on the project, sir.

As the years move on, one by one, Glenn can't help but recall the beauty of his childhood in 1928, when he flew in his first airplane alongside his father, and looked outwards into the beautiful Ohioan landscape, with the heavens above him and the powerful figures beneath him like a man watching over an anthill. \n\n"Now, as I said before, Mr. President, the Dresden Generating Station and myself, Executive Director Fergusson, greatly appreciate your visitation to the reactor and the approval for its creation, as we hope to serve the great citizens of Illinois!" the executive director said, shaking the President from his nostalgia.\n\n"Ah, yes, speaking of which, I was wanting to ask: how many people will this provide power for?" the President asked.\n\n"Oh, ah, well, Mr. President, the full potential of the facility is still being estimated; however, at startup, we believe the facility should be able to power all of Morris as well as a great deal of Chicago, resulting in current estimates reaching about one and a half million homes!"\n\nThe director's statement shocked the President. One and a half million people, one and a half million functioning households, one and a half million happy Americans to live another day in warmth and happiness thanks to the work of nuclear energy. Soon, the President stood within dreams of American households across the nation being able to thank the government for both providing a healthy and happy means of energy production, but an entire way of life, with America standing at the top of the globe by taking a new step into the future of progress, glory, and potential. A new age for the United States was ready to begin. \n\n"Umm, Mr. President, are you okay?" Director Fergusson asked as the President stared at a window into the facility."

The President sat, silent, gazing at the television sets before returning to meet the eyes of his staff. Metzenbaum and Rockefeller both felt uneasy at the President's reaction to the uplifting news of the television program, as he seemed dreadfully upset by the news.\n\n"Mr. President, is everything alright?" Metzenbaum finally chimed in, breaking the silence of the room.\n\nImmediately, Glenn barked back at the men, "The both of you, follow me, now."\n\nThe two men quickly followed Glenn, awaiting the news that could possibly have the typically gleeful President so perturbed after the great news. Finally, the President escorted the men to an inconspicuous car, making for the driver's seat, and hurdling off into the Maryland evening. The car ride was silent. Finally, Glenn parked on a hill, shrouded in darkness, but offering a beautiful look over the White House and several beautiful sights of the D.C. area.\n\n"Get out." The President commanded.\n\nThe two men did as ordered then Glenn walked them to the trunk. The President lifted the trunk door, where the two men saw an ice chest, which the President took hold of and turned to the men.\n\n"My one regret," the President said, "is that I couldn't share a beer with the two men who made this all possible. Flight training made alcohol taste terrible for me."\n\nThe two men looked shocked, disturbed, and honestly fearful, as Glenn's stern expression melted into a warm smile and into a roaring laugh, as the men joined in by grabbing their beers and cheering the night away, with a beautiful, starry sky above and an incredible nation before them."

One of our advisors has been in talks with the Walt Disney Company to start creating some informational materials, to make sure the people are being told the truth. We'll get our own scientists and public relations officials involved to keep everything as accurate and educational as possible, and make something that Americans of all ages will understand.\n\nThe first decision we need to make is what to focus on.

Big name is not what we need, sir: the, uh, big effect is what we need, sir!" claimed director Nathan Juran, as President LeMay sat behind his desk, trying to struggle in listening to the mannerisms backing the foreign director's speech. "With Disney's big budget, use me and we can make the, uh, movie magic!" said Juran. "No, no, no, I'm sorry, Mr. President, but Mr. Juran here is thinking only in the artistic side of things, and, quite frankly, if you seek to see this film succeed, there's gonna be a lot more backing this movie than some fucked up visuals, sir!" said the other man sitting across from the President, a certain Stanley Kubrik. \n\nAs the two directors continued to argue back and forth, President LeMay sat further and further back in the already uncomfortable chair he had to sit in, day in, and day out. Gone were the days of committing to executive and decisive military decisions on behalf of the United States Armed Forces; no, now all LeMay had to do was pick between these two idiots on who to run the nuclear movie to help win Americans over. On one side, we have Juran: while not heavily regarded for the plot of his movies, do we really need that when we're focusing on scaring the American public into realizing that we need nuclear missiles? Man could think of horrific images to make for film that even LeMay hadn't seen before. Meanwhile, on the other side, we have Kubrik, the ever famed, and ever assholic movie director who seems to be thinking he's gonna be making Beethoven's 5th. To his credit, Kubrik can make a fantastic war movie, and even LeMay can attest to that one. \n\nNow, as the two men argue back and forth, it's time to decide: do we go full on and scare the hell out of America with Juran, or ease into it with Kubrik?"

Exactly how this made it in front of a test audience is unknown, but there have already been several firings at Disney over this debacle.\n\nAs for our policy position, a room full of crying children and angry parents is a bad look, and it's probably best to sweep this unfortunate project under the rug as soon as possible.

At present time, the United States wields strong control over the Shinkolobwe (also called Hermannsville) mine, as well as a looser hold upon the surrounding Katanga region. Resource extraction is currently being initiated, and rail lines to South Africa are being set up such that the resources may be exported back to the United States.\n\nForces of the 1st Marine Division and 101st Airborne Division attacked the mine as their first major target in the region, coming under fire from what were later confirmed to be soldiers of the German S.S., presumably left over from the fall of the Reichskommissariats in Africa. Some officers have conjectured that the Germans were exporting the uranium from the mine back to Europe, but most experts of USAFRICOM disagree. The Germans were put under heavy fire by marines arriving in gunboats, while airborne flanked using helicopters, leading to many of the remaining Germans being killed or fleeing. As far as is currently known, casualties from this initial strike number 40 American killed or wounded, with over 300 German killed.\n\nFollowing the success of the attack on Shinkolobwe, the marines spread out through the jungle in pursuit of the retreating S.S. elements, meeting none. Meanwhile, the 101st, assisted by US Navy reconnaissance jets, attacked several surrounding villages and towns, most notably Likasi (also known as Jadotstadt).

Without hope for evacuation by air, due to a failure to establish radio contact with other military elements, the Major Wilhelm decided to hold off the majority of the attacking force with only a company of marines, while the remainder would attempt to reach riverboats and retreat to a forward operating base just downriver. This strategy appears to have worked, though it would seem that the Major and his company were captured and then executed. Platoon-strength elements of the surrounding towns failed to report whatsoever, and are presumed MIA. In total, American casualties from the engagement number at least 400, and possibly up to 600.\n\nWith so many American dead, it has become impossible to hide this operation from the American public any longer. With the permission of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and POTUS, I strongly suggest a full retreat from the Katanga region, and the Congo Basin as a whole.\n\n-General Norman Schwarzkopf, United States Africa Command"

glenn.20.desc:0 "Yesterday, in a heavily anticipated counterattack against the German and African warlords that nearly forced American forces to abandon the Katanga region, American forces reclaimed the town of Likasi as well as the vital mine of Shinkolobwe. Involved units included a majority of forces of the 1st Marine Division, supported by elements of 101st Airborne Division and air wings of the United States Navy 6th Fleet. The attack utterly shattered the thin alliance between the warlords, revolutionaries, and S.S. forces under Heinz Barth, sending them retreating back into the jungles with significant casualities.\n\nThe attack was centered around the village of Panda, just to the south of Likasi, where American close air support drew S.S. units out of their entrenched positions with use of napalm and white phosphorus munitions. Once drawn out, helicopter elements of the 101st Airborne surrounded and destroyed the fleeing German units. This then cleared the way for the several brigades of the 1st Marine Division to cross the Panda River and march on Likasi from the south and southwest. Meanwhile, the remainder of the 2nd Battalion, 4th Marines, supported by reinforcements of the 1st Battalion and close air support, advanced on the Likasi from the east. The Africans, likely having seen the destruction wreaked upon the S.S., broke formation and retreated to the north after only a few minutes of combat.\n\nDespite the temporary setback, it appears much of the imported mining equipment is still intact. After executing a few search and destroy missions to hunt down the last of the S.S. that escaped the bombing of Panda, the mines should be ready to export their uranium resources back to the United States.\n\n-General Norman Schwarzkopf, United States Africa Command"

glenn.21.desc:0 "Yesterday, in a heavily anticipated counterattack against the German and African warlords that nearly forced American forces to abandon the Katanga region, American forces initially reclaimed the seemingly-abandoned town of Likasi before being pushed back into the jungle in a fierce stalemate. Despite nearly half of the 1st Marine Division participating in the attack, they were once again caught off-guard by the guerilla tactics employed by the African forces. The S.S. remnants, equipped with highly-effective German weaponry, also impeded the marines.\n\nThe initial planned attack proved unnecessary, as reconnaissance showed the town of Likasi to be abandoned. Upon arriving at the town, the marines found nothing more than burning buildings and mass graves filled with American servicemen. Distressed by this discovery, the Africans, now emboldened and in greater numbers than during the previous attack, sent small groups of soldiers to prod the marines into an engagement. Taking the bait, the marines chased the Africans into the jungle, where they found themselves quickly divided and surrounded by the Africans' superior numbers. In addition, the formerly-S.S. warlord Heinz Barth sent several APCs which the marines struggled to destroy. In a dire situation, the marines called for air support, but due to poor visibility through the jungle canopy, several bombs were dropped on American positions, killing and wounding many.\n\nOverall, the operation was an abject failure. Reaction at home, though somewhat dulled due to the lack of information, can be described as extreme. The Department of Homeland Security is recommending a full withdrawal in anticipation of nationwide protests and riots, and I am inclined to agree. It is clear to the officers of the United States African Command that nothing of further value can be found in the Congo. America's enemies there are numerous, well equipped, and strongly convicted, and thus, it is no longer in the interests of the United States to continue her campaign there.\n\n-General Norman Schwarzkopf, United States African Command"

As most of the local resistance was believed destroyed, the marines failed to bring any major combat equipment with them on their excursion to Kapolowe, aside from their firearms.\n\nThe Congolese attacked using a captured German APC, and, without heavy weapons, the marines were unable to disable it. The APC, accompanied by several hundred lightly equipped African militia chased the marines out of the village and into the dense jungle beside it. Their advance was only halted by the arrival of close air support elements that dispersed the Congolese. Overall, the enemy appear to have suffered 37 dead, while the engineers lost 25 men with another 39 wounded.\n\nWhile this defeat was quite small and had with a minimum of casualties, the marines were caught totally off-guard, and it is the United States' greatest loss in the region since the fall of Likasi. News of the humiliating retreat appears to have reached the media back in the homeland, and public reaction so far seems less than positive.\n\n-General Norman Schwarzkopf, United States African Command"

The catwalk was purely for inspecting the missile; should anyone be in here when the rocket launched, may God help their mortal soul. Regardless, barring the start of total nuclear war, no missiles would be launched today.\n\nGlenn stood admiring the massive, cylindrical creation of aluminum and steel, with a heart of plutonium. It was awe-inspiring. The power of gods, sitting right before him, with the judicious ability to wipe the face of the Earth clean. However, unless pushed to the edge, America would never fire first. It had these purely for defense, of course; insurance, in case the worst came to pass. He turned to the director of this new facility, a man named William Baughman.\n\n"What's the range on this missile?"\n\n"The Minuteman III claims a range of around 13,000 kilometers," he said, "that's roughly 8,000 miles, and farther than any other missile currently in service on the planet."\n\n"Incredible," the President said, "and they don't even know we have it. Krauts and Nips would be shaking in their boots if they knew all the stuff we got up to. America needs a strong nuclear defense, and I'm glad my administration was able to help provide for it.""

glenn.24.desc:0 "Jack sat down on the couch with an ice cold bottle of suds, ready to enjoy an hour or two of TV before heading back outside for more yard work. He clicked on the TV, his small antenna catching only the most powerful signals over the air. The display flickered to life, showing a black and white broadcast of what appeared to be President John Glenn, examining some variety of bomber aircraft. Several of them flew overhead while the President himself admired a stationary one on the ground. The President and his entourage then moved over to the side of the runway they were standing on.\n\nJohn Glenn turned to face a reporter who was slightly out of frame. "So why do you think this new bomber is so revolutionary, Mister President?" asked the reporter, in that half-condescending, weirdly intonated reporter-voice that they always used.\n\n"Well, for starters, it's easily the fastest bomber in the world. The B-1 Lancer can reach a top speed of over 1.25 times the speed of sound. You know, a lot of people ask me why we don't just replace bombers completely with missiles. Well, for one, if we have a false alarm, and we start to send out bombers, we can always bring 'em on back. With a missile, once you launch it, it's not coming back. A pilot has discretion, as well. He's able to gauge the value of a target; whether it's a threat or not, or whether it's worth hitting. In short, I think that the new B-1 Lancer is going to greatly strengthen our nuclear triad. It's, simply, a fine new jet. Now let's watch one give us a little show, eh?"\n\nWith that, the President turned and gave a thumbs up, presumably to the pilot of the bomber he was examining just moments ago. The massive jet fired up it's engines, and promptly threw the President on to his ass, rolling backwards like an armadillo, and his aides following suit, scrambling over to help but only being knocked down themselves.\n\n"Well damn," muttered Jack, "must be a helluva jet to knock the President on his ass.""

Stepping through the sparkling glass doors, and trailed by several black-clad agents of the Secret Service, the astronaut-turned-president found himself greeted by an old friend: James Webb, administrator of NASA. "Hello, James," said the President, smiling.\n\nThe administrator reciprocated with a smile of his own. "A damn fine facility you've let us build, John," he said, "and, by God, a damn fine path it's going to carve for us. Lemme show you around; we've already got several new projects in the works."\n\nThe President and his entourage of guards followed Administrator Webb through the vast halls of the new Houston facility, pointing out new projects along the way. "So, down here we have planning rooms for future programs and technologies; namely, the Orion Project, the Diana Program, and the Integral Launch and Re-entry Vehicle."\n\nThe President shrugged. "I'm a bit out of the loop these days, James. Why don't you fill me in?"\n\n"Well, Diana is the current plan for another attempt at the moon. In theory we could figure out where Apollo went wrong and use that knowledge in future missions. The Re-entry Vehicle Project, or ILRV, is the current plan for a reusable space plane we could use to get things into orbit at lower cost, like satellites to spy on the Krauts and Nips. Orion is... well... we want to launch heavy loads into space by using nuclear weapons as propulsion."\n\n"And what's all this leading up to, if you don't mind me asking?"\n\nThe Administrator smiled, turning around and walking towards a seemingly nondescript door at the far end of the hall. "I was hoping you'd ask that." \n\nReaching the blank door, he opened it and entered, followed by President Glenn. Inside, the room was poorly lit, but filled with bulky computers and desks, all manned by busy men and women. On the walls, illuminated maps of the Red Planet glowed. Terrain and topographical maps of potential landing sites: Utopia Planitia, Valles Marineris, Elysium Planitia, and several others.\n\n"We're already planning?"\n\n"Come on, John," replied Webb, "we've always been planning. It's just been a matter of funding."\n\nPresident Glenn inhaled deeply, gathering his thoughts. "Well," he began, "you'll have as much of that as you need, and more.""

On the other hand, we could simply build one massive rocket, powerful enough to get to the moon and back."\n\nGlenn leaned back in his chair, scratching his chin, "well... why not both?"\n\nA short laugh came from the other side of the line, followed by a pause.

No longer would the President have to hold NASA's hand in person; rather, the organization could be managed with only a call and a filled coffer. Today, the President would meet with the administrator, James Webb, to formulate a comprehensive plan for NASA's future.\n\nStepping into the meeting room, Glenn noticed that it was empty, save Webb and an intern or some such that he did not know.

"Well," he said, "give me the quick-and-dirty."\n\n"NASA today is pursuing so many projects and moving in so many directions all at once that it is simply unsustainable. So, now, every program we fund will have to cross your desk first. Each program has different benefits, and each has a price. The way I figure it, and as much as you and I would want to, we can't afford to pursue every project that might be worth a damn. Not only because it would be expensive, but because it would anger the public. People find the space program to be a novelty, not a necessity; too much money poured into it and America will grow weary of the stars."\n\n"So your job will be organizing all of these programs," replied Glenn, "while I make sure the other areas of government get adequate attention, and that we don't bankrupt the country in the process."\n\n"Yes.""

The President was glad that even with all the technological advancements, NASA's message stayed the same.\n\nIt was time for lunch with the new recruits. Within a few minutes of conversation, Glenn could tell that these guys weren't as nervous about the great beyond as he was back in the day. If anything, they were nervous about talking with the President, but those feelings were gone after an hour. Glenn spent most of the time both reminiscing on his own experiences and marveling at all the up-to-date training methods.\n\nAs the day progressed, President Glenn had to say goodbye to his new friends. As he boarded the plane for Washington, the man couldn't help but feel ecstatic about the future of NASA with him at the helm. At the same time, though, a sense of dread was creeping up on him: if something bad were to happen, he would be solely responsible.

Other explorers spread their knowledge across the globe, permitting entire civilizations to connect for the first time. Our people's Manifest Destiny shaped our country into the superpower it is today. Even much of our ocean remains unexplored.\n\nBut now is the time for us to shift our focus to the stars.

It was his sole mission to bring his native country beyond the space threshold that contained his predecessors. He mused the potential space future of America over some coffee before the phone at his desk rang.

We wanted to ask you since the NASA budget is growing tighter every day."\n\nThe Saturn project! This rocket is going to be the spark that ignites the country's interest in space, and the President would need to respond fast. Glenn knew how expensive liquid rocket fuel was, and if he were to choose this option, all NASA mission costs from now on would increase. This would help to further ensure a successful mission, but due to the increased costs, the public would grow more unhappy.

Younger, progressive House members have contacted us to inquire about whether the administration could use its influence over their body to have the Pension Security Bill amended in committee. Specifically they want a proviso requiring expanded pension benefits for those struggling with disabilities acquired over the course of their life.\n\nThe administration had already been weighing whether to raise benefits for those born with disabilities, but this puts the President in a more difficult position. The progressives will be offended if we do not help all disabled, not just some, but at the same the conservative and free market elements of the Party are already critical enough of the proposal as is, they are unlikely to support aiding those who "made poor career choices" or "failed to act in a safe manner."\n\nThe House Majority Leader has proposed a way around this hurdle. A proposed rider for the bill was increased military pensions for disabled veterans. This had NPP support. Should we fold the disabled veterans rider into the amendment for those disabled as adults, we might just get enough NPP support to pass the bill even with defectors from our own party. This will greatly offend the conservatives, though. Should we do it?"

While the bill has already had a section added ensuring that welfare payments for low income households are exempted from pension taxation that would further complicate their already troubled situation, that only worsens the situation they may face upon retirement.\n\nThe progressive faction in the House have presented a package of amendment sections and riders to the bill to address this issue. The amendments authorize the government to access welfare funds to pad the pension checks for low income pensioners, while the riders expand said welfare budgets by increasing social safety nets, unemployment benefits and social assistance programs.\n\nNeedless to say, adding this package to the bill would be a... courageous decision. The conservatives and business lobby are likely to howl bloody murder (or at least "Bukharinist Mania") at expanding welfare via rider, but like with the disability provisions, there is a chance we may be aided by NPP defectors and still pass the bill.

The proposal however enjoys significant support in the northeast, one of President Glenn's most important voter bases. It is politically sensible to pass price controls to at least some extent, but we could never push it through Congress as it stands.\n\nAs such, we will have to do it via executive order, something which is sure to infuriate the opponents of the proposal, especially among states rights proponents with the Democrats.

The letter from the House majority leader was lengthy and flowery in its expression of concern with the integrity of the Party's congressional representation, but the threat veiled between the lines was obvious even to someone without long political experience.\n\nOpen protests in the media, corporate donors backing out of campaign funding and perhaps trying to sabotage the economics of the insurance market to weaken the party on the West Coast, even a threat of attempted congressional censure from his own party, should the President not limit his planned price ceilings for drugs.\n\n"Sir?" the Chief of Staff trembled.

glenn.48.desc:0 ""Mr. President, they're ready for you." the diligent special agent said to President Glenn, who had been sitting backstage, preparing for the big speech today.\n\nGlenn thought of the crowds of people willing to attend a public speech, especially one regarding the sheer corruption of the government, and how he may help change a few people's days around for the better. A smile grew on the Ohioan's face. \n\n"And now ladies and gentlemen, we welcome the United States President John Glenn to the stage." The Governor of Missouri said before being rushed with exuberant cheers of the crowds, as President Glenn emerged on stage, giving a wide smile and the wave of his hand to greet the growing crowd before him.\n\nStepping up to the podium, Glenn began his speech. "Good morning, my fellow Americans! Before we begin, may we offer a large thank you for your state's hardworking Governor for allowing me out here today?"\n\nThe crowd cheered his name, with laughter and joy. Glenn eyed several poster boards made for the event, including one marked "Shoot for the Stars!" With a rocketship and a star next to it, giving the President a good laugh. \n\n"Now, I know everyone is anxious about our administration's new project, so allow me to explain. My dear Americans, it has been my duty to instill a sense of duty and empathy within every citizen, and while we have progressed tremendously in our goals, there remains a great obstacle in our path: corruption. Government officials who have become stooped down to lowly levels in an attempt to earn more for themselves, and will bring the consequences of such behavior into federal processes. It is not right, it is not fair, and we mustn't allow it to continue any further. Whether it be in the legislative branch or the executive branch, our administration stands ready to combat any form of corruption which seeks to plague our nation any further."\n\nThe crowd of northerners and midwesterners stood in awe at the President, but soon grew into loud cheers as the President went on."

Needless to say, I think it was only about ten minutes after that he decided to tuck his tail between his legs and scamper out of the dinner party."\n\nOnce more, the President and the Chief of Staff exchanged some laughter and smiles. \n\n"Now, Mr. Metzenbaum, I sadly have to inform you that we still have to start work at some point today, so let's get to the point: we still need to work on those reports found of the effects of some of the new policies. What do you have for me?"\n\nMetzenbaum unveiled a manilla folder containing a variety of documents inside, before giving it to the President.\n\n"To put it bluntly, sir, the measurements the administration put together and put into effect, well, work. A variety of officials in the government have rescinded deals they had made with less reputable organizations and businesses, and there have been reports that processes in the government are moving faster by as much as 105 percent in some committees." \n\nThe President, though appearing confident and expectant over the news, was, more than anything, proud. Proud of himself of course, but proud of his administration, proud of the work put forward, proud of their progress, and even proud of the officials that turned sides to clean themselves up. The government was one of the aspects of American society that needed to close that gap of empathy present in the modern day, and they had managed to make progress in closing what seemed like an endless canyon of anti-trust and deceit.

glenn.50.desc:0 "Once more, President John Glenn took some time out of his day to look past the curtains held over the windows of the Oval Office. As the sun pierced through the clouds above the city, Glenn breathed in deeply with a large smile. The Ohioan knew that it was going to be difficult to see as beautiful a view as the one he'd been taking in at that moment. But for now, without the worries of the future plaguing his mind, he allowed the songs of the birds to fill his ears, and the warmth of the setting sun to run over his face. The President had become, as so many around the country praised him for being throughout his Presidency, happy. \n\nFor now, Glenn knew that America was ready to take its next steps forward in the world. His administration was not going to last forever, and while there were still issues to handle in American society, he knew that they had done all they could. After so many years, work had been put through to close that sorrowful gap of empathy that was present for so many years in the saddened American society. The weak, the needy, and the downtrodden had finally received the work they needed to rise out of their pits of sorrow and pain. The people of America, both the abled and disabled, all had a form of financial security to hopefully guide them into a healthier, happier, and brighter future. For once, the people of the United States managed to see that a part of their government had truly become freed from the reigns of corruption, even if by the smallest amount. After such long periods of suffering for Americans across the country, Glenn knew that now hope stood strong in the hearts of the citizens he had guided for his term in office. \n\nWith such images of hope and greatness flowing through the President's mind, he had been reminded that not all of the world shared such similar stories of success and steps forward. The beaten down men, women, and children across Europe had suffered long in their continuous battles against their vicious oppressors. Similarly, with even a note of revenge in the United States, the Pacific had remained embroiled in conflict, with man against man across the many islands of the sea. However, something changed: they had somewhere to look for hope. An example, a shining example, of what they could be, what they ought to be, and the beautiful sight of the future ahead if they made sure they could become as prosperous as the United States of America. \n\nGlenn had failed to respond to the opening of the door to his office behind him.\n\n"Mr. President, are you alright?"

glenn.56.desc:0 ""Mhmm. Yep. I see." President Glenn muttered, as he scribbled some notes down quickly on a small notebook retrieved from his pocket, with the Oval Office's phone in the other. "Completely understood, and in doing so, we will consider everything we can for your idea, we are here for the American worker, don't you forget that! Be sure to reach back if there are any other projects we can expand upon! Alright, thank you, George." President Glenn said with a small laugh before hanging up the phone. \n\n"Well, Mr. President, who was that, if I may ask?" Metzenbaum asked, having been called into the Oval Office well into the middle of a phone call.\n\n"Mr. Metzenbaum, I'd like to ask you for some advice. We've already gotten to work on hammering out all the details of this abolishment of the Right-to-Work laws. Now, we have some possibility to reach out even further." the President said.\n\nMr. Metzenbaum could never quite get past the shock of every moment of Glenn's genuine empathy. "Well, Mr. President, the large corporations have already expressed their opposition to such support for the unions, but what did you have in mind?" \n\nThe President sat in silence, pondering the issue back and forth. "Mr. Metzenbaum, I just got off with a colleague working with a few groups to collaborate on some legislative ideas, and he's informing me that unions across the United States have stated their desire to enforce a 6-hour work workday across the board." Glenn said, watching Metzenbaum's typical shocked expression.\n\n"Mr. President, sir, I know that we must care for the American worker, but businesses will be at our party's throats if we reach that far, and the Department of Commerce has established possible economic difficulties if we reach too far out for the unions." the Chief of Staff noted.\n\n"I understand, Howard, but if we aren't going to be the one that reaches out that far, who will?" He said, doling respect out to his justifiably shocked colleague.\n\nThe American workforce has been one of diligence, one of survival, but shouldn't such men and women enjoy the freedom of their lives along with their worklife? Or are they right, and we're all going to pay for it, or worse, the bill gets killed before it can change anything?"

glenn.58.t:0 "Congress Passes Bill Abolishing the Right to Work"
glenn.58.desc:0 "After months of preparation within the West Wing, the bill forwarding the notion of abolishing United States' Right to Work laws has been successfully approved by the House of Representatives and the United States Senate. President John Glenn regards the signing of the bill into law as being a "massive success for the American working citizen, and a crucial part of ending the stranglehold held by unfair workplaces and businessmen in the oppression of their workers." The Glenn administration is not the only group singing praise towards the passage of the bill, as many within the Department of Commerce have given large signs of approval towards the President in his cause to end the difficulties of the American working class. \n\nRight to Work laws safeguarding a worker's right to not participate in a workers' union has been criticised by many common citizens. A coal miner from Virginia offered his applause to Glenn today as he said that "lots of people out there believe that the President is trying to get rid of us workers' rights. However, I'd have to say, in knowing of a lot of folk out there who try to reap the benefits of unions without actually giving anything up, I think he has some pretty damn good intentions in what he's doing up there in the White House." Many such hardworking citizens stood in praise of the bill's final success in the legislative process, and many continue to celebrate into the night, allowing for them to return to work more safe and secure than ever before. \n\nHowever, that is not to say that everyone agrees with the Glenn administration's work to end the Right to Work. Many large business owners have offered criticisms to the press in response to the passage of the bill. "We business owners of America find that this bill is grouping us all together in some form of 'oppressive' class in America today! I run a business, a business with regulations that I find fair, or else I wouldn't have employees in the first place! President Glenn is looking to sink the American economy into the ground!" \n\nAs both parties celebrate and brood over their successes and losses, time can only tell how the American working environment will be changed by the Glenn administration's work."

glenn.59.desc:0 "The ongoing battle between the business owners of the United States and the Glenn administration over the abolishment of Right to Work laws culminated tonight, with victory on the side of the business owners. Many large corporate leaders offer their cheers and celebrations in the aftermath of the battle within the Congress tonight, as they have successfully reigned in more control over their employees. One such business leader, standing on the steps of the Congressional building, proclaimed that "America will stand to see freedom in her economics without the meddling of the government!" \n\nOn the other side of the battlefield, federal employees, lawmakers, and many other workers within the presidential administration gave a face of solemnity yet strength. President Glenn offered his words in response to the failure of the bill, saying that "We, as an administration, have fought continuously for the rights, safety, and fairness of the lives of American employees throughout the country. Having said that, though we may face defeat on the Congressional floor tonight, we stand ready once more to continue that fight, for all American workers who stand wronged in the face of those stealing away the benefits of their unionization. We will not stop, not today and not tomorrow." \n\nThe bill itself held a very divisive outlook in the eyes of the citizens of America. One of the owners of a large Kentucky-based corporation expressed joy in the killing of the bill tonight, saying that "the President was assuming at best and prejudicial at worst, Americans across the nation won't need to join any sort of union within my business to know that they can find happiness from it." A dockworker from Connecticut, on the other hand offered his condolences to the administration, admitting that "I have seen many of my fellow workmen proceed to take away benefits of our union without paying any form of dues. It's not right, and knowing that I'll have to return without the support of the President's bill makes me sick. We continue to stand with you, Mr. President.""

glenn.60.t:0 "To Subsidize, or not to Subsidize"
glenn.60.desc:0 "President Glenn, all throughout his electoral campaign, pushed for the introduction of Social Security, an idea that was proposed and promptly defeated during the administration of Kennedy Sr. In recent weeks, the President has been pushing for the reintroduction of this concept into reality, in accordance with his campaign promises. In a recent press conference, he said that he and his congressional allies were "currently drafting a new Social Security bill."\n\nIt is unclear exactly how far this new welfare bill will go, but if the President's comments during his campaign are anything to go by, it will likely prove fairly comprehensive and extensive. It will at least cover all Americans over the age of 65 years and those who have disabilities which prevent them from working. There appears to be some debate among the Republican-Democratic party as to exactly how strong these benefits will be. The more conservative congressmen in the party, mainly democrats, have said that the retirement fund offered by the program should only be from the taxes and trusts that retirees put money into during their working years. The more liberal elements of the party, mainly Republicans, claim that while the Social Security trust fund is an essential part of the process, they are simply not enough to cover the needs of most Americans in their twilight years and that the federal budget must be adjusted such that the government directly subsidizes the trust fund. Under this plan, Americans who claim Social Security will receive more in welfare claims than they put in while employed.\n\nShould the President pursue the more comprehensive, subsidized Social Security, the bill is anticipated to lose quite a bit of support from the Democrats, as well as receive a flat-out rejection by the Far Right-NPP. The bill has yet to be fully drafted however, so the question remains: how far will President Glenn go?"

The President himself has made it clear that he supports a very strong Medicare system, in which all those over the age of 65 or suffering from a disability have their healthcare expenses met in-full. This would likely require additional government subsidization of Social Security, and an even angrier mob of conservatives in Congress. \n\nThe Democrats, as can be expected, have proposed a more moderate, but still comprehensive plan. In it, Medicare would only cover roughly 30-50% of healthcare expenses for eligible individuals. Wallace F. Bennett, generally considered the leader of the Democrats in the Senate, has declared that he will absolutely not support a Medicare plan that wastes so much money on coverage that the average retiree "doesn't need". Some congressmen in the Far Right-NPP have expressed slight amiability towards the Democratic proposal, but have made it very clear that the President's position is simply unacceptable. Without much conservative support, there is the question as to whether the bill will pass at all. As such, the President and the Party must make a choice between his desire to cover all healthcare costs under Medicare and his need for party unity and bipartisan support on the bill."

While the more conservative Democrats among the R-D's initially seemed hesitant to sanction such an expensive program, they quickly calmed once they saw that the President was open to compromising on the issue.\n\nUnder this new welfare program, all Americans over the age of 65 years, and those grossly affected by disabilities, are now permitted to claim a monthly financial stipend from the United States government. The actual amount of assistance given by the stipend varies from person to person, as it is based off of percentage of taxes paid during a claimant's working years."

It appears that the President and his progressive supporters underestimated the conservative's willingness to oppose the act, as well as their own ability to vote as a group. Several Republicans walked across the aisle to vote against the bill with their supposed political opponents.\n\nOverall, the whole debacle surrounding the act and its subsequent defeat in the legislature have been largely blamed upon the President, his allies, and their unwillingness to compromise on critical issues with the more conservative congressmen. In addition, the R-D's as a party find themselves much more divided than prior to the bill; it would seem that such a comprehensive and drastic bill has flared up intraparty tensions once more, and the party is one step closer to dissolution.\n\nAs for the average American, life will go on. While they may not have much to live on in their twilight years, they never have before. A large section of the population is up in arms over the Social Security Act's failure, and will likely remain so for some time. One thing is certain: this is not the last we will see of Social Security."

Glenn paced in his office, looking at the papers stacked up on his desk. \n\n"The Senate Ethics Commission is going to change the face of the current legislative process in order to make sure that not a single Senator will be acting without the greater interest in their hearts, but now, we have to worry about the leader: between a Democrat or a Republican." Glenn sat down, and took a look around, the phone on his desk taking his interest first before taking a stack of Social Reform bills and sifting through them. "Promoting a Republican would allow them to create a strong grip over the Congress, and allow us to make it easier for Republican-centered programs and bills to navigate through the already effective process, helping out all those poor Americans who need our help now more than ever." He put the papers back on his desk before massaging his eyes. \n\n"But, the Democrats would probably throw a fit. After all, they're right when they say that getting rid of corruption within the government should not be a partisan effort, and knowing them, they are probably going to accuse us of pinning blame for the corruption on them if we don't put in a Democrat head of the Commission."

Opening the door, the President's chief political advisor was standing in the doorway. "Sir, you're going to want to come see this." \n\nThe President got to his office, when he had seen the cause for all the alarm: a message faxed over to his office, from one of the Democratic Senators of Texas. He looked over the document carefully. "Your decision in picking the head of the Senate Ethics Commission was politically-charged and unfair." The President gripped the bridge of his nose, having known that this decision was going to be a brake on progress at worst, and a headache for him at best. "We henceforth demand your compliance in reversing your decision. Doing so will allow the Congress to act unitedly, and allow our party to remain equal without the Republicans or Democrats overtaking one another. Members of our coalition have even voiced desires to defect to the NPP if you do not meet our desires for justice and equality in a Congress soaked to the bone with corruption and injustices. We are doing this for America, Mr. President, as it is our duty to act for our constituents alone, with fairness." \n\n"This is going to make the Republicans chew me up and spit me out if I go along with this." Glenn said, recognizing the dangers in working towards unity within his own party.\n\n"Now, Mr. President, I know this looks bad, but hear me out: if we were to say, keep going, maintain our current course, maybe they will back off, realize that you represent the head of the party, and your knowledge of Presidential matters surpasses their desires.

Many of you agreed with me. Together we took the first step, and once again, we are lifting our gaze to the skies. Once again, America is headed to space."\n\n"Since then, we have taken many more steps. NASA has been strengthened and remolded into a leading light for science and exploration in this country and the world. We have recruited the best scientist, the brightest engineers and a team of astronauts that is second to none, and we've given them enough funding to get to work. That work has already born fruit. A great many steps have already been taken. We are closer than ever to the stars."\n\n"It is time to avenge Apollo and take back our rightful place as the pioneers and explorers of the solar system.

And yet, man has set foot there. Eberhard Köllner became the first man on the moon in 1962, planting the flag of the German Reich on its surface. But it won't be alone up there for long! The same Artemis program that gave us these images will soon send an American Astronaut to plant the Stars and Stripes up there alongside it."\n\nOnly when the program was completely done did Peggy stir. She rose slowly before turning to her parents. "Mommy, daddy, when I grow up I'm going to be an astronaut." She spoke with absolute confidence, as if stating a plain fact rather than an aspiration. \n\n"Sure you will, but tonight it's already way past your bedtime." Keith answered, getting up to get her settled in bed. It didn't take long. "I'll tell ya," He said upon returning to the living room, "I've never seen her focused on anything like that space stuff."\n\n"Me neither. Y'know I was about her age when the bomb hit Pearl Harbor. Tore my world right down. I don't think I've ever quite shook that feeling. I wonder if this'll be a moment like that for her. Maybe she'll turn out different from me."\n\n"Not too different, I hope", Keith smiled, "Don't want her taking after her dad instead."\n\n"Not like that, you bonehead. Different about the world. More hopeful. Who knows, maybe she WILL be an astronaut one day."

"Should I have done it? Are they really going to defect to the NPP after all of the work we managed to put together?" A bang catapulted Glenn out of his inner thoughts as he looked up and into the crowded doorway of his office, as Metzenbaum stood followed by several advisors. \n\n"Mr. President, I think you need to see this." \n\nThe row of TVs in the Oval Office were lit up with images of protests and speeches. Around the nation, especially in the South, members of the R-D Party stood furious over the announcement of the Republican being entitled as head of the Senate Ethics Commission. Various Democratic Senators gave speeches within their precincts, rallying citizens behind them in their protest against "unfair partisanship" and "the disgusting singling out of Democrats in investigations of corruption." Some even moved forward with their official resignations from the R-D's followed by their treasonous joining of the NPP in front of a live audience, followed by cheers and frantic ravings from the crowds below. The media had already jumped onto the bleeding carcass of the crisis unfolding and doled out statistics of plummeting support for the R-D party in response to the grave accusations of abuses of Republicans' control in the government.\n\nAll around the room, advisors stood sweating, tapping their feet, and pacing around the room to deal with the pressure facing them. Metzenbaum himself, a man known for his miracles in the legislative process, stood with mouth agape and sweat running across his forehead. After a long few minutes of processing the situation, he turned and asked. "Mr. President, how do we handle this?""

In general, a win-win for everyone.\n\nHowever, it's becoming clear that most of the money earmarked for the NNC are being funneled to civilian uses, with big reactors being built all over the country to power homes and factories. This is great for citizens to see that their taxpayer money is going to a good use to help them with lower power bills and less pollution from coal and oil power plants. But only a trickle is going to the military, to allow the research, modernization and construction of new weapons to provide the "nuclear umbrella" that keeps America safe. The complaints and outrage of the generals and admirals are circulating in the Pentagon, and Strategic Air Command is livid. There are more and more leaks to newspapers about how the military feels they are being sidelined, that there will soon be a gap between the US, Germany and Japan in everything from missiles to submarines to strategic bombers\n\nAlienating the military on what is already proving to be an expensive and controversial program is really bad news. The President's opponents in Congress and the media are already clamoring to scale back the National Nuclear Commission, re-prioritize its objectives, or even scrap it all together.

glenn.76.t:0 "Big Oil vs. Nuclear Power"
glenn.76.desc:0 "For over half a century, the world ran on one resource: oil. Even today, petroleum is vital for the economy; to keep the country's cars, ships, trains and planes moving; to refine into chemicals, plastics and synthesized rubber; and to burn in power plants to provide electricity to millions, and natural gas to provide heating. All of modern life depends on the oil industry.\n\nBut now President Glenn is moving aggressively on his plan to build nuclear reactors everywhere, to power the nation with atomic power, through the National Nuclear Commission. That is an increasingly worrying concern for the boards and stockholders of the big oil companies like Exxon, Texaco, Mobil, and Standard Oil of California. If America is less reliant on oil products for electricity and heating, then a huge section of the market will disappear nearly overnight, and they will lose millions, if not billions, of dollars.\n\nAnalysts predicted that it would be years, if not decades, for nuclear power to become cost-effective, and the oil companies had banked on that. Then Glenn came in, subsidizing the building of reactors, and the price of nuclear energy is dropping fast. Soon, it will be cheaper to build a big expensive reactor and then deal with the minimal maintenance costs than it would be to keep prospecting and shipping oil to refineries and then to power plants. That's the last thing the big oil companies need.\n\nOf course, they will never say that it was for their bottom line. No, instead it will be talking about the possible dangers of radiation and meltdowns, the security of oil reserves in Texas, or the use of government funds to subsidize something that the private market would be better to handle. Big Oil, working through shell companies, are going to fund Glenn's opponents such as the NPP, who are not as keen on spending billions to build reactors all over America.\n\nAnything to save the industry that has powered America and the world this far into the 20th century."

glenn.77.t:0 "Not In My Backyard!"
glenn.77.desc:0 "The National Nuclear Commission determined that the best places to build nuclear power plants are in areas with small towns, farmland, and on the edges of major cities: the land is cheaper and easier to access, and to provide new jobs in areas that need them. However, those underdeveloped areas also happen to be close to the iconic small towns of Middle America and the sprawling suburbs that have redefined American life since the end of the war, where a lot of well educated, white, middle class Americans live.\n\nAnd many of those in small towns and suburbia across the US are really not liking the fact that they are now going to be living next to a giant concrete monstrosity of cooling towers and giant reactors.\n\nThe concerns are varied: the ugly buildings, the lower land values, the threat of radiation, the risk of meltdowns, the dangers of nuclear waste, blocking further development, the fact that there is development, and just the loud noises of construction. Tactics to oppose the construction of new reactors are also innumerable: protests at country or town meetings, pickets at construction sites, vandalism of machinery, letters to newspapers, calls for action from state representatives or the local Congressman. The opposition to the NNC is coalescing into a new movement that is being called the "Not In My Backyard", or NIMBY.\n\nWhile much of the new NIMBY movement is grassroots and local, there have been rumors that outside groups are providing funds and support for these groups. Investigations by media outlets have traced the funding through a myriad of people and shell companies, and eventually to the source: America's big oil and gas companies. But these discoveries, often buried and resulting in reporters reassigned or fired, haven't dampened the movement at all."

She was still coming out to the gates of the big nuclear power plant, her old and worn sign reading "No to Nuclear!" to protest it. The numbers had dwindled a lot since the first stories of how they were going to be building two reactors near town a couple of years ago first came out. Back then, half the town, a couple hundred people, would show up at the planned construction site next to the river, waving their placards, signing petitions, and writing to their representatives in Congress. Nancy led them, for her house was right next to where the plant was going to be built. The last thing she wanted was her children to be turned into bug-eyed mutants with three arms!\n\nConcerns were addressed, promises were made. Security guards kept people away from the roads and into a specially designated protest zone. But as the weeks went on, the concrete cooling towers went up, and the fancy computers and electronics were installed, despite all the chanting and clamouring. The numbers of protesters began to dwindle then: it was going ahead anyway, so why bother? But Nancy and a few dozen refused to give up. What can be built can be torn down.\n\nThe grand opening a few weeks ago was the final nail in the coffin: the guided tours of the plant, the explanation of safety features, did much to satisfy those concerns, and the hiring of locals and the arrival of new families did much to bolster the local economy and keep the local schools viable. Nancy's husband soon declined to come out with Nancy to protest a "done thing," and more and more people said they had other things to do. But Nancy, and her friend Mary, refused to give in.\n\nBut it's been half an hour already, and Mary hasn't shown up. Maybe she was ill? Maybe her son had some extra homework? Or maybe she finally gave up as well?\n\nNancy sighed, letting her sign fall to the ground, as clouds of harmless exhaust billowed from the towers.

Turns out flying fighter jets and going to space have done a lot to make him calm and collected in everyday life, or when you are President, facing off a bunch of Democrats livid over the cost of the National Nuclear Commission. "If we don't spend the money to make them safe and stable, then we will have to spend more down the line to repair... or worse."\n\n"This damned nuclear program is blowing a hole in the budget," another senator said. "We can't constantly keep borrowing money for all these pie-in-the-sky projects of your's, Mr. President."\n\n"These nuclear plants will more than pay for themselves over their lifetime. Thirty, forty years," Glenn replied. "Lower power costs, less pollution, healthier people. We don't have to pay for Arabian or Persian oil. And the army is going to be stronger, and therefore America is going to be stronger for it."\n\n"That's all well and good, Mr. President," the second senator said. "But we have to worry about the money. And now we are going to have to borrow more, piling on more debt, to pay for all these plants. That's going to be on our children and grandchildren to pay, all so we can have some fancy power plants now."\n\nThe President took a deep breath. "I understand your concerns, gentlemen.

glenn.80.desc:0 ""Mr. President, I received a letter from the Joint Chiefs of Staff today. And, well... see for yourself," Secretary of Defense Cyrus Vance said, handing the several page long letter to John Glenn.\n\nGlenn took the letter and began to read, frowning as he did so. "So they are angry that we are focusing on nukes? But that is what they wanted!"\n\n"But they are throwing a tantrum at the Pentagon because we aren't spending as much on everything else: tanks, planes, aircraft carriers. Basically the non-nuclear stuff." Secretary Vance sighed. "You can just never make the children with stars on their shoulders happy it seems. Give them nukes, they want tanks. Give them tanks, they want helicopters. And on and on it goes."\n\n"Yeah, they all have their own idea of what will win the next war, and what won't, and that's different from the next guy," Glenn said, setting the letter down, and rubbing his forehead. "So they want a bit of everything."\n\nSecretary Vance nodded. "But we can't do that. Congress would throw a conniption if we ask them for more money. Unless we take it from the NNC, but that will slow the construction of new reactors."\n\nGlenn turned his big chair around, to look out the windows toward the Rose Garden, contemplating his options. Ask Congress for more funds for the military, which they won't like. Divert funding the National Nuclear Commission, which would slow down the construction and development of new reactors or atomic projects. Or tell the Joint Chiefs off, making them even grumpier than they are now.\n\nIt's days like these where Glenn wished he was still an astronaut."

glenn.81.desc:0 "Word in the Pentagon spreads quickly. In the world's largest office building, with over 20,000 people working in it, news, rumors and gossip always spreads fast. But the news that there would be no additional funding to the Department of Defense due to the National Nuclear Commission program has spread like wildfire. Admirals and Generals alike were apoplectic at the thought of their pet projects that will, for surely, guarantee victory in whatever future battles America will face, was still not getting the funding they needed. Instead, it was more nukes, missiles to launch the nukes, bombers to drop the nukes, and submarines to sneak around with nukes. Because the problem with nukes is that it's a wrecking ball, when sometimes all you need is a flyswatter. There is talk amongst some that President Glenn, a war hero fighter pilot and brave astronaut, had forgotten where he came from, and his time in the White House meant he had lost sight of what was truly important in safeguarding America.\n\nHowever, everyone in the building, from the office workers that deal with the draft paperwork to the Head of the Joint Chiefs of Staff know that they can't reveal their displeasure at not getting more money. Congress would roast them alive in committee meetings for wanting this money, and the public would not be too keen on having to foot the bill on yet more experimental projects.\n\nSo, while the tempers are high, there will be only a minor ripple that escapes the Pentagon. But that doesn't mean that soldiers, sailors and airmen are happy. Even the Secretary of Defense, and the President himself, knows that morale has grown weaker as appreciation for the military seems to be lagging. Sure, the current budget is all well and good, and the equipment that soldiers have is still top of the line and better than anything in the world... but it can always be better."

All the extra funding going toward reactors and research was feared to be dulling the edge of America's conventional weapons: the tanks, planes and ships that would be needed to fight smaller scale wars.\n\nThat means the news that came out today, in a short news release, should please the generals and admirals concerned, since some of the money that had been earmarked to the construction of reactors or the funding on nuclear research "that had few benefits at this current time" had instead been diverted to several "promising conventional weapons systems to keep our military strong."\n\nWhile the NNC is still ongoing, and will be going on for a while to come, some money that was to go toward the planning and designing of reactors and programs that had not yet started construction will instead be held back and moved to defense procurement projects. Those reactors and facilities under construction will continue their progress, but newer ones will be slowed down in the future.\n\nThe mood in the Pentagon is much calmer and more relaxed since the news came out, as it's clear that the President was not going to turn his back on the men and women that are defending America in a tumultuous world. The knowledge that the Commander-in-Chief is supporting them has improved morale amongst all ranks, from private to General, and that he will prioritize the defense of America over everything else."

The few hawks in Congress were nearly totally sidelined, as Democrats, C-NPP and other enemies are working together to try to reign in a President that seemed to be out of control.\n\n"The President is asking the taxpayer to continue throwing their hard-earned dollars into the bottomless pit that is his vanity projects.

To pass the bill, there were pork barrel projects galore shoved in to appeal to certain members of congress. After all, who would vote against a massively bloated budget bill if that bill happened to have the money for a new bridge, or hospital, or highway for their district? The Republicans in Congress seem to have no restraint, gladly shoveling billions of dollars into everything that the President wants and needs. Democrats are bolting the party, and the President's approval rating across the nation is cratering. The NPP is taking advantage, harping on how the President's spending is going to tank the economy, building big and ridiculous monuments to his ego like the dictators of Europe. \n\nAt the end of the day, with favorability ratings dropping, the debt skyrocketing, and politicians of all stripes gunning for him, President Glenn can at least take some satisfaction in knowing that at least the military really appreciates the support and funding."

Even some of the President's staunchest supporters, more concerned with holding their seats in the next election, either abstained or voted against the law. \n\nBut for all the support for the rest of President Glenn's ambitious agenda that got him elected, even this was too far. Billions of dollars has been spent on NASA, the National Nuclear Commission, and all the other programs and projects he favored already, and the will to spend more is just not there. The fear of higher taxes, more debt, and more red ink on the books is too much.\n\nThe biggest casualty for the President though is his standing amongst the troops. The failure of the bill has already sent shockwaves through the military establishment. How can America defend itself from new Nazi planes? Or cutting edge Japanese ships? How does the United States plan on winning the next war without it going nuclear? The anger is focused on the President, and not the penny-pinching Congress though. It's Glenn's fault, for focusing his time and effort on his nuclear power plants and bombers, and not on the needs of the Army, Navy, and Air Force. He promised so much to the troops, to get them better equipment, training and housing. And yet, he failed."

By mid-afternoon, the halls of Congress were in an uproar as business lobbyists stormed receptive congressmen's offices, demanding an explanation for President Glenn's "socialistic madness." \n\nThe reaction varied amongst the mining companies that, soon enough, received notifications from the government informing them of their new management. A few broke ranks throughout the day, seeking an accommodation with the Glenn government that would at least keep their management in place.

The mining companies had wasted little time presenting new uranium contracts to the administration after their legal victory - and the bill had risen threefold. \n\nVice-President Gore rubbed his eyes, sunken in their sockets after days of preparing for the Supreme Court hearings. "I wish that were the end of the bad news, but Gallup's got the latest polling surveys for us."

The phones in the West Wing were ringing with an intensity that one would expect them to burst into flame at any moment. Officials of various ranks hurried from meeting to meeting to assure everyone that, while yes, things were clearly tense now, the administration is working tirelessly to ensure America's safety. And tirelessly they worked, paddling hard to stay afloat. But it wasn't like the graceful paddling of a swan, it was more akin to the panicked flopping of a fish who had just been thrown onto dry land. \n\nIt was certainly how President Glenn felt, sitting behind his desk in the Oval Office. The worst of the crisis had passed, fortunately. Despite everything, he was still sitting behind his desk, instead of in an underground room in the Pentagon. So in a way, there was progress: no nuclear exchange today. \n\nWhich meant the aftermath had to be considered. \n\nBefore Glenn's desk stood one of the many suits of the State Department. Across the world, so the diplomat told the president, USA embassies were flooded with inquiries about what the hell had happened and why.

The administration had tried, optimistically perhaps, to force nuclear disarmament from a position of strength. Achieve strategic supremacy, and from that position enforce global disarmament. By now, after everything that had happened, the strategy became once again what it once was: an idea, and an impossible one at that. Tensions were high, very high, both internationally and domestically. \n\nLooking back on how it had backfired, Glenn thought of himself like a gambler in a game of poker, revealing his cards only to to see his opponent had a Royal Flush all along. Perhaps the truth of the matter was nothing so dramatic: no miscalculations from the start, but simple bad luck. Or perhaps the president's strategy had been predestined to fail, being built on shaky foundations. Or perhaps the idea was sound, but executed poorly. It hardly mattered now, and these questions were nothing but food for thought for future historians. \n\nWith a few swift strokes of his pen, the deed was done. America's programs to expand its strategic nuclear arsenal as President Glenn envisioned, came to an end. And with the closing of this chapter, a new chapter opened. It was a chapter Glenn was not looking forward to: \n\nFixing the mess."

It had been the third time the president had used this routine this day. \n\nAll these congressmen and senators coming to voice their concerns over the administration's foreign policy. Glenn was playing a dangerous game. Glenn was risking nuclear annihilation. Glenn learned nothing from the recent crisis. \n\nGlenn had heard it all by now. \n\nYet, the president had to entertain some of them in the Oval Office, if only to show his own party that he took their concerns seriously. He understood very well, after all, his administration had considered a more dovish response when the recent crisis threw the White House in chaos. Now he had dozens of his own party demand he'd tone down. \n\nPresident Glenn would listen and patiently explain why he believed this course was the best course of action. We have to stick by what we believe, and not allow our love of peace to turn into a fear of action. Some listened, a few were persuaded. But, at the end of the day, it became clear to the president that, politically at least, his policy carried a heavy cost. The divides within our party grow larger."

Yet, it was slightly less than yesterday. And yesterday it was slightly less than the day before. Gradually, the realization dawned that the administration was returning to normal operating protocols. Whereas a week ago the White House was still at a proverbial code red, right now, that code had shifted to a slightly less pronounced hue: orange, perhaps? \n\nAfter weeks of damage control and crisis management overworked officials could finally breathe a sigh of relief, knowing that at last they could get a good night's sleep for once. The president too, after crisis cabinet meeting after another, slowly returned to the old peacetime day-to-day rhythm of the presidency, sinking back in the relative comfort of the routine of government. \n\nThe public won't soon forget everything that happened. We have been close to the brink, closer than we had been in a long time. But now is not the time to rest. Every statesman knows politics is just going from one crisis to another, with various periods of relative calm in between.

What's more is that another uranium mine in China was utterly destroyed, killing several workers who were present. One convoy carrying uranium from China to a port on our island was also sabotaged.\n\nThe only clue we have right now is that all sabotage attempts happened within minutes of the last; clearly, the acts are connected. We suspect that growing unrest in our Chinese population is to blame, but we will conduct further investigation into the suspicious activity. While our uranium supply can be regenerated, admittedly, the effort will take some time.

Unfortunately, the saboteurs made their escape before the local police could arrive at the scene. However, seeing as the attacks happened within minutes of each other, it is safe to assume that the attacks are connected.\n\nOur diplomats have been surveying a number of strange events happening to uranium mines across the globe. Accidents have been reported at numerous uranium sites, and trade routes involving the shipment of uranium have been temporarily shut down. No events like these were reported in our sphere until this morning, when our own uranium sources were abruptly hijacked. Overall, it appears as though the amount of uranium circulating is starting to decrease; this news comes at a bad time as our nuclear arsenal requires more maintenance than ever before.\n\nOur top military advisers urge us to conduct more investigations into the crimes committed this morning and apprehend the perpetrators who are responsible. However, this action could get in the way of our repair; though it will take some time, our uranium supply can be regained.

Our top domestic investigators have done all they can to find a likely suspect, but our research bears no fruit. Top politicians and leaders are furious about the lack of evidence, and our reputation on the world stage is currently under attack. Some foreign officials have started to believe that we do not have full control over our country. We have to bring these malicious vandals to justice as soon as possible.\n\nFor the time being, as our uranium supply took a big hit, our nuclear stockpile must be compromised. It is a tough decision to make, but perhaps we can invest in other military resources while we wait for domestic intelligence to complete their task.

Late last night, the group of Americans were just about to begin another attack against our western mine when several officers caught them in the act, knocked them unconscious, and sent them to the investigators for their identities to be determined.\n\n'This was a severe diplomatic mistake made by the American government, and we will make sure they pay for their international crime,' one domestic official claimed when he first heard the news.\n\nTwenty of our workers were killed in the attacks on our mines, and another hundred were severely injured.

These husks of men and boys appeared as though they left their own souls back at the mine. Business as usual. "Sklaven," the headmaster yelled, "move out!"\n\nAnd so another day began for the slaves.

How's yours looking, Herr Rüdiger?"\n\nThe old man dropped the phone and stared in disbelief. He looked at the mine himself and saw nothing. He panicked; he had a quota to deliver!

A few German investigators are considering the possibility of a Japanese spy or an American infiltrator as the cause behind the uranium raid, but there has been no confirmation. The criminals could very well be a handful of slaves who gained "independent thought" the night before and decided to test their luck on a successful raid. Simply put, we can't gather enough evidence to make a definite conclusion.\n\nThe good news is, we can rebuild our uranium supply. Our nuclear arsenal will grow back in due time.

glenn.114.desc.germany:0 "After Japan made the announcement that the United States had been tampering with uranium mines in China, our own domestic investigators have been working harder to uncover the identities of the saboteurs. Foreign diplomats in Washington are being dialed by the minute just in case they find any clues that relate to our uranium shortage. Many more slaves have been interrogated and either shot or released back into their service, but we haven't obtained any answers from them. However, there is a growing number of speculation that the Americans were behind the sabotage of our Polish and Russian mines.\n\nA breakthrough in our investigation has proved just that–the criminals who blew up our mines are indeed American. Unfortunately, we are arriving a little too late to the allegations made against America. Japan was the one to uncover the plot first, so it would be risky to announce our findings immediately. We are still in the process of gathering all pieces of evidence to form a conclusion. It would certainly be beneficial for us to avoid making a public allegation against the United States while we are still in the process of concluding our research. However, this might also be the perfect opportunity to forge a temporary alliance with the Empire of Japan and join them in their public scrutiny against America. No matter which action we take, our police force is working to make our supply lines more secure than ever before, and we will not let any man interfere with our resources again."

As new anti ballistic missile technology develops, the costs of modernizing our stockpiles and reacting to new developments begins exponentially multiplying. President Glenn knows that we have no choice but to either live in peace, die in pieces, or go bankrupt as our stockpile increases. He knows his choice, but it'll be meaningless unless Germany and Japan sign on.\n\nLet's set a time and place for all three superpowers to sit down and discuss deescalation, present our argument for everyone stepping back from the brink, and hope that Germany and Japan can see reason. There will be many issues that could complicate the talks, such as the deterrence argument, fears about Italy and India's nuclear ambitions, the security of the Sphere and the Russian front, and the Japanese fears of a successful US invasion. We will have to be prepared to respond to all of these concerns should we hope to end this world-threatening Mexican standoff once and for all.\n\n"

The Hagia Sophia dominates the landscape, and over 1500 years of history surround you as you gaze across the Bosphorus. A nice Turkish coffee may warm the hearts of our negotiating partners.\n\nLhasa is closest to Japan, and is the ancient capital of Tibet. It is one of the highest elevated cities on earth, and is beautifully nestled in the Nyenchen Tanglha Mountains.

If we all agree we don't want to launch first strikes, then cutting the costs of our atomic arsenals should be a no brainer. This argument will prioritize cutting spending on ABM systems and limiting our ICBM stockpiles. This is a more realistic goal, and will preserve our advantage in the missile gap, but will only achieve very limited spending reductions and disarmament.\n\nThe second is more moral and idealistic: We tell the nations point blank that we cannot let a war between the nations end the human race. We're on the brink of destruction and we all need to step the hell back for the good of mankind. This will lead to massive disarmament and equally massive savings....if it works.

The Zeus, Spartan, and Sentinel ABM programs have already cost us a fortune, and emerging technologies like MIRVs threaten to exponentially increase costs. The Germans and Japanese are spending a lot of money on these too, but if we can convince everyone to throw in the towel on ABM's then we could divert a dragon's horde worth of funding to the NASA budget.\n\nWe have two options: Either we could propose an outright ban on ABM systems or we could propose a compromise agreement to limit their numbers. The first option involves pitching to the Germans and Japanese that ABMs are simply too expensive for what little benefit they bring. Signing an ABM ban could instantly result in massive savings, but concerns about rising nuclear powers such as India and Italy could make the deal unpalatable to the former Axis. We may be better off simply proposing a compromise to limit ABM stockpiles, as this would almost certainly be signed.

Every one of our economists agrees that our ABM program is a fiscal nightmare. At the same time, our generals and admirals are alarmed by this extreme proposal. They point out that concerning reports of the Delhi regime's "Smiling Buddha" program suggest they could soon become a nuclear power. If we have no ABM infrastructure in place at all, Tokyo will be utterly defenseless in the event of a nuclear attack by India. They urge us to consider accepting only limited ABM reductions, leaving intact our infrastructure near the Indian border.\n\nAn Indian first strike is an extremely hypothetical scenario, but the nationalists may just be crazy enough to do it if they get their say.

Dismantling our ABM infrastructure, they insist, will be tantamount to sacrificing the lives of the entire German people and constitute treason against the Reich.\n\nWe could probably wrangle them into a compromise to retain our ABM infrastructure at the Italian border, but there's no way we could get behind Glenn's entire proposal without putting our government in jeopardy.

They are the most important component of the nuclear triad, and modern ICBMs are able to annihilate any city on Earth within 30 minutes. They are what General Hap Arnold warned us about when he said, back in 1943, that "Someday, not too distant, there can come streaking out of somewhere – we won't be able to hear it, it will come so fast – some kind of gadget with an explosive so powerful that one projectile will be able to wipe out completely this city of Washington." They must be limited if we are to save the money NASA needs, but the former Axis won't part with them easily.\n\nOur investigators have come up with two proposals for an ICBM deal: Agreeing to scrap a certain number of ICBMs, or a proposal to convert some of them to cheaper SLBMs. Scrapping them is the most cost-effective measure, and is a clean-cut and simple solution to the ICBM arms race. On the other hand, the powers might balk at large scale disarmament and refuse outright if compromises aren't made. The SLBM compromise stands a better chance of passing, yet we won't be able to save as much money as we would on pure disarmament. Which shall it be?"

The Kriegsmarine has always been an afterthought for Germany ever since the failure of the Hochseeflotte, and they have never had the shipbuilding capacity to maintain a substantial submarine fleet. When faced with an impossible proposal, Germany will have to decline. So we would be wise to bear this in mind when it comes to the ratio of ICBMs to be converted. What shall we propose?"

While SLBMs are cheaper to maintain than ICBMs, they're still dangerous and an expensive pain in the ass. Something needs to be done about these missiles.\n\nOur negotiating team has come up with two proposals: Converting nuclear armed submarines to conventional submarines or scrapping the boats and the warheads together. The second has greater savings potential, but the first may be an easier pill for the other powers to swallow. It may be best not to push our luck, but we could compromise if we get pushback on scrapping the boats.\n\nWhat shall our option be?"

In particular, they object to the reduction in their naval power that would come from scrapping so many submarines. They demand that we, in turn, scrap a significant number of destroyers for the same of naval parity.\n\nTheir objection would put a major dent in our navy and cause some controversy at home. At the same time, we really don't plan on a war. Maybe this compromise is a blessing in disguise? Less money on destroyers means more money to spend on NASA! We may lose face if we agree to this compromise, yet it may also be the only way to get the Japanese to move on with the negotiations. \n\nWhich shall it be?"

As Japan has withdrawn from the talks, Germany sees no reason to remain either and has similarly pulled out. Thus the talks have concluded, with only the ICBM limitation treaty to show for them.\n\nWe've made some progress, but this was still a missed opportunity. SLBMs remain a serious threat to humanity, even the ICBM reduction isn't enough to *completely* eliminate the threat of nuclear armageddon. We must make the best with what we've got, and what we got ain't much. Hope NASA can still use the savings, at least."

glenn.nuclear.222.t:0 "Failure to Launch"
glenn.nuclear.222.desc:0 "The Americans pushed Japan too far, and the talks have ended terribly as a result.

So ends the [USA.GetNuclearPickedCity] Talks, with only an ICBM limitation treaty to show for it.\n\nThe Americans made some progress, but this was still a disappointment for all of us. SLBMs remain a serious threat to humanity, even the ICBM reduction isn't enough to *completely* eliminate the threat of nuclear armageddon.

We could allow the warheads to remain operational, since their range is too limited to be of serious threat to the superpowers. Alternatively, in the true spirit of disarmament, we could have the warheads completely scrapped.\n\nThe parties would be more likely to agree to scrapping them, as it would be more fair. This would result in bigger savings and less danger to the world. But if we have a need for medium range missiles, we could try and push to retain them. Tread carefully, as the powers may not see the point of such a proposal."

The proposal will have simmilar effects to the last one we signed but on a smaller scale, as SLBMs present a smaller portion of our nuclear arsenal. We have already agreed to the previous deal and we have no reason to refuse this one. The deal will benefit us greatly and backing out now might lead to international backlash from the other two great powers."
glenn.nuclear.228.descObject:0 "The Americans have proposed to allow all nations to keep their SLBM warheads after dismantling the submarines. This will allow us to retain a medium range ballistic missile stockpile after reducing our naval capabilities. \n\nWhile these will be useful as deterrents against small scale threats in our respective domains, the maintenance of these warheads will be quite expensive. The Americans may talk of saving mankind from nuclear devastation, and that's a noble goal and all, but we have to save our own budgets as well. It seems hypocritical for them to want to keep the warheads as MRBM's. Perhaps we should demand the warheads be scrapped as well, for the sake of fairness and savings. Getting rid of SLBMs will reduce our nuclear arsenal and will reduce costs, but scraping the warheads as well will do more of both."

It seems, in contradiction of all our previous assessments, that the superpowers are proceeding away from the brink and not towards it. Whether this is out of a genuine, albeit pathetic, humanistic desire for peace or out of a miserly and capitalistic desire to save money on their nuclear arsenals, the clock has begun running counterclockwise away from midnight.\n\nThe Reichsführer-SS could scarcely contain his fury at this development.\n\nAfter briefly recusing himself from the meeting and heading to his office, the Reichsführer-SS returned five minutes later and announced Notfallplan Tal: A special emergency operation to affect the outcome of the [USA.GetNuclearPickedCity] Conference. One of our more disposable agents will be dispatched to the conference under the cover of being a German reporter. He will be given a small, concealable .22LR pistol and ordered to make an attempt on the life of President Glenn. What he will not be told is that it is not necessary that he succeed in his attempt as long as he consumes his cyanide capsule before being interrogated. We need only disrupt the talks and discredit the idea of disarmament, and a German with German papers trying to assassinate the President should prove sufficient for our purposes.\n\nThe Reichsführer-SS has ordered all hands on deck to prepare to deploy our agent within 48 hours.

The President was swiftly rushed to safety and the building was placed on lockdown.\n\nThe man, in custody, promised to immediately write out a confession of his entire plot and asked for his pen and a piece of paper. Unfortunately, when we gave him his pen after he was frisked, he immediately bit down on the nib. The man was dead before his body hit the floor, apparently a case of an intentional cyanide poisoning.\n\nThe man has been identified as a Mr. Ernst Gottlieb, a native of the German Reich. While he had press credentials, he was also in possession of documents indicating he was an intelligence officer within the Wehrmacht.\n\nWe have sent an urgent request to Germany for an explanation, and the talks have been frozen until a decision can be made."

We have also been told that the assailant appears to be a German national, and an officer in the German military intelligence. The assailant also appears to have committed suicide in custody by ingesting cyanide, which surreptitiously hidden in his pen.\n\nAll parties at the talks are alarmed at what has happened, and the talks have been stalled until Germany provides answers, immediately."

glenn.nuclear.303.t:0 "Germany Blames Burgundy!"
glenn.nuclear.303.desc:0 "After an hour, Germany has responded to our ultimatum demanding an explanation. They claim that Mr. Gottlieb's military papers are clever forgeries. While we have been asked to keep this information confidential, they have informed us that the man is almost certainly a member of Heinrich Himmler's Burgundian-SS attempting to sabotage the [USA.GetNuclearPickedCity] Talks.\n\nThey have informed us that while Burgundy remains de jure a part of the Reich, it has been de facto independent ever since the outbreak of the German Civil War. They assert that Himmler has been seen as a traitor to Germany ever since his failed putsch and that he is a top enemy of the Fuhrer. While they are not entirely sure why Burgundy would want to sabotage the disarmament talks, they suspect that Burgundy has staged a false-flag attack to damage Germany's international reputation and sow chaos within the German government in anticipation of a second Himmlerite Putsch.\n\nThese claims about Burgundy smack of a conspiracy theory, one which has little evidence other than the Nazis' word. Yet, it is also unclear why Germany would want to assassinate the President. The fact that the three powers have reached an initial agreement would suggest Germany is interested in disarmament, and doesn't it seem crazier that Germany would agree to a partial disarmament then assassinate the President of the United States than that Himmler would try to sabotage these talks?\n\nThe choice is yours, Mr. President. Shall we trust Germany and carry on with the talks? Or pull out now in case something worse awaits us down the road?"

They are each staying tight-lipped about just who Germany claims the man was working for, but our intelligence analysts suspect Germany has likely placed the blame on the SS Order State of Burgundy, Himmler's de facto fiefdom. President Glenn has reportedly accepted Germany's explanation as valid.\n\nThe Americans may be convinced of the Reich's innocence, but are we? It is astounding that President Glenn would accept Germany's claims so readily, but then again he may have the most to gain from these talks. More pertinently, our military advisors are worried that the American leader may not have been the prime target. What if we are in the crosshairs for a future assassination attempt, and this is a plot by our rivals to cause chaos within our government?\n\nStill, that claim seems a bit far fetched. No one on our team reports feeling targeted. And while we suspect the Germans are neither smart enough nor stupid enough to try and destabilize us by assassinating our leader after signing an initial disarmament agreement. Maybe we can chalk this theory up to the notorious paranoia of our military brass, but bucking their advice may well upset them...what shall we do?"
